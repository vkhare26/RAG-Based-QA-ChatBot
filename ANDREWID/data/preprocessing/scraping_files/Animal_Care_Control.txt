Description of Services

The Bureau of Animal Care & Control provides assistance to Bureaus within the Department of Public Safety, other City Departments and the Allegheny County Health Department in situations involving animals, both domestic and wild. The Bureau enforces City and State codes dealing with animals; issues citations and appears in court; helps to keep our City’s parks animal-nuisance free; works with non-profit animal shelters; provides consultation to other municipalities concerning animal issues; and assists the Pennsylvania Game Commission in tracking the rabies virus.
Animal Care & Control Officers capture stray animals, assist in pet/owner recovery, resolve neighbor disputes over animals, assist the elderly and physically-challenged with animal concerns, advise and teach residents of their responsibility as pet owners, advise non-pet owners of their rights, and assist in the removal of nuisance wildlife. Nuisance wildlife is defined as wildlife that causes, or is about to cause, property damage or that presents a threat to the health or safety of the community by means of disease transmission or direct attacks. The Bureau also quarantines animals, provides removal of deceased animals, and assists police and the District Attorney's office with humane investigations.
Although Animal Care & Control encourages responsible pet/companion ownership there are still over 1,300 dogs and cats picked up yearly. Many are reunited with their homes through a partnership the City has with a local animal shelter.
Due to the wooded mountainous geography of our City, residents share common areas with a host of wildlife (skunks, raccoons, ground hogs, foxes, coyotes, deer, turkeys, etc.) Learn more about how to share space with wildlife by visiting ourLiving with Wild Life page.
The City offers 24 hour service. The Animal Care & Control office hours are Monday through Friday, 7 a.m. to 3 p.m. Please visit ourContact Uspage.
Operations continue from 3 p.m. to 11 p.m. Monday through Friday. Saturdays and Sundays operations are from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m, and on holidays, from 8 am to 4 pm. All "after hour" operations are for any emergency that a resident may have. Call the after-hours number at 412-255-2935.
Responsible pet owners need to know that along with the obligation to properly feed, shelter, and care for a pet, there are laws (ordinances) to protect the animal, the pet owner, and the community.
"Owner" includes every person who keeps or shelters and every person who allows an animal to be on their property (land or house) which is occupied by him or her. This means that if you are in possession of an animal, whether you own it or not - you're responsible for its care, behavior, and welfare.

Rodent Baiting Program

Did you know the City of Pittsburgh has its own Rodent Baiting Program that residents can utilize for free up to two times per year?
Residents must call "311" and request rodent bait, provide their name, phone number, and address.
A contractor will place one pet-safe baiting station on your property, good for about 200 rats or mice. The contractor will not usually make contact with you and will try to place the station discreetly unless a specific location is requested. The rodents will find the station from other areas of the property. After approximately one month, the contractor will return and check the station, replacing the bait if needed. After about two months, the station will be removed.
Only the owner or resident of a property can make the request for their home. The contractor cannot place stations on abandoned properties, empty lots or public ways. The program does not cover apartment buildings with more than four units or businesses. More severe issues at residential properties may have to be addressed privately. Issues creating or aggravating the problem, such as trash violations or poor property maintenance, should be reported to PLI through 311 for inspection.
The contractor does their best to fulfill requests in a timely manner, but due to the irregularity of the volume of requests and depending on the time of year, there may be a delay of up to several weeks in placing the station initially.

Living with Wildlife


Having issues with wildlife?

We have effective, inexpensive, and humane solutions.


- Always make sure your garbage is properly stored. It should be in a trash can with a lid this is Pittsburgh law! With the food source removed, the animal will move on.
- Unwanted animals in your garden? Try humane harassment techniques, like a hot sauce repellant, sprinklers, or lights!
For more animal specific solutions, check out theHumane Action Pittsburgh's "Love Your Wild Neighbor"tips atLoveYourWildNeighbor.orgthen select the animal from the directory.

Nuisance Wildlife

Sometimes an animal has already entered your home or is causing damage to your property. Nuisance wildlife is defined as wildlife that causes, or is about to cause, property damage or that exhibits unusual behavior that may indicate a threat to the health or safety of the community by means of disease transmission or direct attacks.If there is an animal inside your home, please call the office directly for immediate assistance.

Trapping Doesn't Work and Should Only be Used as a Last Resort

It’s important to remember that live trapping wild animals only temporarily solves a problem.Many studies have shown that live trapping wild animals actually creates a vacuum that allows more animals to move into that now open area. Also, less competition for food among wild animals means that more offspring will be born each year.
There are many cities as large or larger than Pittsburgh with about the same wild animal population that do not allow their residents to live trap any wild animals. These city residents have learned how to live with the wild animals in their respective cities.

Trapping Nuisance Animals



- Understand that, due to state regulations, all groundhogs, skunks and raccoons that are trapped will be euthanized.
- You can contact Animal Control 412-255-2036 to borrow a humane trap for up to two weeks in certain situations or use your own trap.
- You must follow the rules of outdoor live trapping (see below).
- Once you have trapped an animal simply call Animal Control at 412-255-2036. Morning calls are preferred as more officers are available to remove the animals. For urgent situations after office hours call 412-255-2935.
- During peak season there may be a wait time of several weeks to receive a trap.

Wild Animal Outside Live Trapping Rules and Restrictions

- Only one trap per property is allowed. The trap may only be set/animal picked up once a day.

- Once an animal is inside, the trap cannot be located in direct sunlight or on hot concrete, asphalt or other similar surfaces.
- Do not place traps on slanted roofs
- Live traps must be placed on the resident’s property only.
- Only live humane traps are allowed to be used. Leg hold, snare or traps that cause harm or kill the animals are not allowed.

- While a wild animal is inside of a trap it may not be tortured or harmed in any way.
- Live traps are not allowed to be put on roofs, in trees or far underneath decks, patios or porches.

Animal Control FAQs


There is a loose dog in my neighborhood, what do I do?

Dogs are not allowed to run loose in the City of Pittsburgh. We like to help ensure the safety of people in the community as well as trying to reunite the dog with its owner. To report the loose dog, please call the Animal Care and Control office at 412-255-2036 Monday through Friday between the hours of 7am and 3pm. Outside of these hours, please call 412-255-2935. If you feel you are in imminent danger from the dog, it is appropriate to call 911 at any time.

There is a loose cat in my neighborhood, what do I do?

There is no law against cats roaming free in the City of Pittsburgh, but they are required to have a collar with identification. If you have found a friendly cat without identification, animal control officers will pick it up if it is contained in some way (carrier, cage, humane trap). Animal Care and Control is not able to respond to calls regarding loose cats that are not contained. We are able to provide a humane trap for residents needing to capture a cat on their property. Please contact the office at 412-255-2036, Monday through Friday from 7am to 3pm to discuss trapping.

I lost my pet! What should I do?

Losing a pet can be a very stressful experience. Following these steps can help reunite you with your lost pet more quickly:


- Be proactive! Nobody expects a pet to go missing, so your pet should always wear a collar with an ID tag that has your phone number on it. Check the tag regularly to ensure it is still readable.
- Have your pet spayed or neutered. In addition to all the health benefits, it decreases an animal's desire to roam away from home. Pittsburgh residents are eligible for the City's free spay/neuter program for up to 5 pets! Check out the Spay/Neuter Program tab for an application and details.
- Get your pet microchipped this permanent form of ID can't be detached or obscured. Local shelters offer microchips at reduced rates. Make sure to keep your information updated with the microchip company if you move or get a new phone number
- Take photos of your pet (as if we had to ask you to do that!). Be sure to keep a few current ones on hand for emergency purposes
- If your pet has gotten away from you, call the local shelters. The open door shelter in Pittsburgh is Humane Animal Rescue at 412-345-7300. You need to file a lost report with them in case someone finds your pet. However, because descriptions may vary (you might call your dog tan while a shelter worker calls him yellow), it is best to visit the shelters in person. Making a flyer complete with color photos of your pet will help! You can bring a copy of the flyer to local shelters, post flyers around your neighborhood, and post the information to social media sites.
- Any animal picked up by Pittsburgh Animal Care and Control is taken to the Animal Rescue League, so if you've filed your lost report with them, you are covered if your pet is picked up by our officers

The cats I see in my neighborhood have a funny looking ear, are they strays?

We're glad you asked! Cats with an ear that is "tipped" or notched (see photo) aren't really strays. They are feral cats. This means the cats are not tame, but they are cared for by someone in your neighborhood. A cat with a tipped ear has been spayed or neutered and vaccinated against rabies. These cats help to keep rodent populations in check. They are no danger to residents, but should not be approached, as they are essentially wild. For more information on feral cats, please check outwww.alleycat.orgor call the Animal Care and Control office at 412-255-2036 Monday through Friday, 7am to 3pm.

I don't like the way my neighbor cares for his/her pet. Can you help?

We're glad you're concerned about the anima's well-being, because we are too! You can call the Animal Care and Control office at 412-255-2036 to discuss your concerns. You may remain anonymous if you wish. Concerns about animal neglect or cruelty may also be reported to the Humane Officers at The Humane Animal Rescue at 412-345-7300 or Animal Friends at 412- 847-7000.

My neighbor's dog barks all the time. Can you help?

It's possible that your neighbor doesn't know his/her dog barks all the time. If you know your neighbor, you can try talking with him/her about the problem. If you aren't comfortable talking with your neighbor, feel free to call the office at 412-255-2036 Monday through Friday, 7am to 3pm, and we can help to resolve the problem. Please have the address of the property where the dog lives available when you call.

I still have more questions.

No problem, just give us a call at 412-255-2036, Monday through Friday from 7am to 3pm, for any other questions or concerns. Please note, this is for general questions or concerns only. Any requests for services or concerns about an animal's welfare should be submitted directly to the office via phone.
