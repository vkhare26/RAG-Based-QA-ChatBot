Clean Pittsburgh Commission

The Clean Pittsburgh Commission (CPC) was established in August 2005 through legislation introduced to City Council by then Councilman Doug Shields and co-sponsored by then Council members Dan Deasy, Bill Peduto and Luke Ravenstahl. The CPC’s mission is: to work to improve the environmental quality of life of Pittsburgh residents through litter, illegal dumping and recycling initiatives.
The CPC is comprised of representatives from various City departments, local non-profits, individuals and community groups. The activities of the CPC are focused in three primary areas:
- Monitoring/awareness/prevention
- Clean-up
- Enforcement
The primary function of the CPC is to provide oversight, direction, leadership, resources and assistance to community groups and individuals while serving as the liaison between these groups and the appropriate City departments.

Upcoming Meetings

The Clean Pittsburgh Commission has traditionally met on the 2nd Thursday of each month, with varying times and locations to give more opportunties for more people to participate, as all meetings were open to the public. During the pandemic, we have moved online to Zoom, and have had our meetings live streamedevery 2nd Thursday of the Month at 10:00 AM to 11:30 AMand with all recordings posted to the City of Pittsburgh's YouTube channelCityChannel.
As long as we continue this format, we our ability to open up the meeting to everyone is unfortunately curtailed. We encourage everybody to watch our meeting videos and reach out to us with any questions or concerns to bring up in meeting, and we look forward to post-pandemic when we can meet together with the open public once again!

Ethics Hearing Board

Public service is a public trust. The City's Ethics Code has been enacted to preserve the trust placed in the public servants of the City, to promote public confidence in government, to protect the integrity of government decision making, and to enhance government efficiency. The Ethics Hearing Board is composed of nine members holding reputations of personal integrity and honesty, tasked with enforcement and education regarding the Ethics Code.

Advice and Enforcement

Advice isacritical function ofany governmental ethics office.The Board, and its Ethics Officer,providefree guidance to help you recognize and avoid ethics problems.
Complete theRequest Advice Formto send us your question!

Who Is Covered by the Ethics Laws to Receive Ethics Advice?

Anyone covered by the Board’s jurisdiction can receive free advice: current and former officials and employees (and those who, although acting under contract, appear to act as government officials and employees), consultants, applicants, candidates, contributors to campaigns for City elected office, vendors, and persons and entities who do or seek business with the City (including the owners and officers of such entities, and subcontractors).
The Ethics Hearing Board may also act with respect to those who induce, encourage, or aid anyone to violate any provision of the Code, give gifts to officials and employees or their relatives, or are otherwise covered by the provisions of the Code.

Three Types of Advice

Ethics laws are complex with many defined terms, exceptions, and overlapping requirements. With all of our advice, we apply the law and regulations to help you know how these ethics rules relate to your unique situation.

(1) Informal Advice

The Ethics Officer offers informal advice through email, phone, or in-person consultations. While this guidance can help address immediate questions or concerns, it is not binding and does not extend the protections of formal advice.

(2) Board Opinions

The Ethics Hearing Board issues formal, written opinions providing guidance that serves as a defense -- the Board will dismiss any future complaint relating to conduct in conformity with issued formal advice. The Board’s Opinions interpret the laws, regulations, and relevant precedents, ensuring clarity and compliance with ethical standards. Board Opinions, rather than Formal Advice, are issued on complex issues and topics that are novel to the Board.

(3) Formal Advice of Ethics Officer

The Ethics Officer is authorized to issue formal advice on behalf of the Board in response to inquiries previously addressed by a Board Opinion, and other clear areas of the law. By relying on these established sources, the Ethics Officer ensures that the advice is consistent with existing legal and ethical standards, providing clear and reliable guidance. Formal advice can often be issued with a quicker turnaround time than Board Opinions.

FAQs


How can I request an investigation into potential ethics misconduct?

The Ethics Hearing Board has enforcement power over negligent and willful violations of the Code of Conduct.
You can request investigation into potential ethics misconduct. Even if you aren’t sure about all the details, every tip helps. Our thorough investigation process helps to confirm or to create compliance.
We investigate potential violations of the Code of Conduct. Here’s a general overview of some of the topics under our jurisdiction:


- Conflicts of interest
- Use of position to influence a business or property with personal or family connections
- Use of authority for private gain
- Voting conflicts
- Campaign finance
- Personal use of City property, information, facilities or staff
- Nepotism
- Post-Employment
- Offering, soliciting or accepting gifts
- Disclosures
- Wrongful use of the Code
- Retaliation
Tips and complaints can be filed by anyone, including the Ethics Hearing Board itself.

What is the Board's investigative and enforcement process?

The Ethics Hearing Board is bifurcated, or separated, into two different groups. One group serves to process complaints, and the other serves on hearings.

Is formal or informal ethics advice binding?

Formal advisory opinions are binding on the Ethics Hearing Board in a subsequent proceeding concerning the same factual situation. For the opinion to be binding, the party requesting advice must be truthful and must fully disclose all of the material facts at issue.

Is advice a defense?

While you are free to seek other legal advice, please note the Board will not accept advice of counsel as a defense in an enforcement action; only formal advice of the Ethics Officer or Ethics Hearing Board may be considered as a defense.

Can I ask for reconsideration?

A request for reconsideration must be received by the Board within thirty days and allege either that (1) a material error of law has been made; or (2) a material error of fact has been made. The Ethics Officer's decision upon reconsideration may be appealed to the Ethics Hearing Board.
The Ethics Officer or Ethics Hearing Board may also reconsider its advice on its own initiative, providing notice to the requester.

Board Members and Meetings

Governmental ethics agencies, like Pittsburgh’s Ethics Hearing Board (EHB), primarily function to provide advice on a broad range of conflict of interest laws. Public service is a public trust. We aim to ensure public positions are used to further the public interest and not manipulated for private gain.
For public officials and employees to be able to identify when to request advice, ongoing training and education is offered by the Board on governmental ethics laws regulating their conduct and mandating disclosures before, during, and after public service. When necessary, compliance is achieved by the Board through confidential complaints, investigation, and enforcement.
Our mission is to preserve the trust placed in the public servants of the City of Pittsburgh, to promote public confidence in government, to protect the integrity of government decision making, and to enhance government efficiency.

Municipal Campaign Finance and Election FAQs

(for City of Pittsburgh local ballot issues and elected offices of Mayor, City Council and Controller)

Who must file?



- CANDIDATES. All candidates for Mayor, City Council, and Controller must file campaign finance reports for every election they appear on the ballot. A "Candidate" is someone who has publicly announced their candidacy or filed nomination documents with the County. Note, some candidates, such as third-party candidates, may not appear on the primary ballot. Candidates need to file a form based on the amount of their campaign activity as well as an Unsworn Declaration if you do not use a notary. Use the Campaign Finance Statement, a one-page form, for activity of $0 to $250. Use the longer Campaign Finance Report to detail activity of $250 and above.
- CANDIDATE COMMITTEES. In addition to the filing required of candidates, if the candidate has a committee, that committee must also file to disclose their activity. If the Candidate operates through the Committee, the Candidate's personal activity may be $0, thus requiring the Candidate to file the Campaign Finance Statement (which is the one-page form for activityunder$250), and the Committee would likely file the more detailed Campaign Finance Report (a detailed form which is required for activityover$250). Again, even if the Candidate's activity is $0, they must file to verify this fact to the public. Committees must also file an Unsworn Declaration form if you do not use a notary.
- POLITICAL COMMITTEES,INDPENDENT SPENDERS, andBALLOT ISSUES.If you spend $100 or more "to encourage or defeat an election outcome" you may need to file. "Election outcomes" encompasses everything you can vote on -  both candidates and ballot issues. The requirement to file applies regardless of whether you are individual, a group of persons, organization, political party, corporation, political committee, etc. The form used to file will vary based on whether you meet the legal definition of a "person" or a "political committee." Political committees operate with the purpose of influencing the outcome of an election, including but not limited to covered elections. The deadlines to file are the same deadlines set out for candidates. Individuals complete the state's Independent Expenditure form.Committees use the Campaign Finance Report, (or the Campaign Finance Statement if the activity is from $100 to $250). Both individuals and Committees must also file an Unsworn Declaration form if you do not use a notary.

Donor or independent spender? (ballot issues and candidates)

Donors and Independent Expenditures:


- When you donate to a campaign, that candidate or committee handles the required reporting for you.  (That is, unless you're a candidate, committee, etc., with disclosure responsibilities)
When you donate to a campaign, that candidate or committee handles the required reporting for you.  (That is, unless you're a candidate, committee, etc., with disclosure responsibilities)
- When you spend $100 or more independently of a campaign donation, you may have made an independent expenditure and need to file with the Ethics Hearing Board. The requirement to file public reports for independent expenditures applies to both ballot issues and candidate races.

Learn more in the "Who Needs to File" FAQ above.
- Note, while both local and state law define "independent expenditures" the same way, the type of activity which triggers reporting differs. State law requires "express advocacy" to trigger reporting, whereas the City of Pittsburgh law (and, as of 2023, Allegheny County) does not require express advocacy. Instead, our local law requires reporting when the spending is made merely "to encourage or defeat an election outcome."

- You can pay online, through the same way the City collects real estate taxes.Pay Online With a Credit Card or eCheck
- You may also be able to pay at the Cashier’s window walk-in hours during the times available for payment of real estate taxes. The Cashier’s Office may be reached at 412-255-2525.
- Remember to emailEthics Hearing Board staffof your payment.
The City Code provides a $50 per day late fee for each required filing.


- Example: If a candidate fails to file their report in March, or if they file a deficient report, they will be fined $50 each and every day that goes by until the required reports are received (with potential additional fines assessed by the board or courts if the matter is not timely corrected). If the same candidate also fails to file in April, they will then owe $100 per day: $50/day for the March filing and $50/day for the April filing.
In calculating the amount due, do not include the date of the filing deadline. Count every day it is late from the day after the deadline. If the filing was due on the 7th, and you file on the 8th, you are one day late and need to pay $50.

Contributions and Limits

A contribution includes:


- Any payment, donation, gift, subscription, assessment, contract, payment for services, dues, loan, forgiveness of a loan, advance or deposit of money or any valuable thing, to a candidate or political committee made for the purpose of influencing any election in this Commonwealth;
- Paying debts incurred by or for a candidate or committee before or after an election;
- Purchasing tickets for events such as dinners, luncheons, rallies and all other fundraising events;
- Granting discounts or rebates not available to the general public;
- Granting discounts or rebates by television and radio stations and newspapers not extended on an equal basis to all candidates for the same office;
- Any payments for the benefit of any candidate;
- Any payments for the services of any person serving as an agent of a candidate or committee by a third party;
- Any receipt or use of anything of value received by a political committee from another political committee; and
- Any return on investments by a political committee.
- Note: Limitations related to contributions do not apply to volunteer labor hours.
Limits:
Contributions come in many forms beyond monetary donations, including but not limited to: a comped ticket, special discount from a vendor, or even someone else's spending to a third party based on the circumstances. There are additional restrictions on cash donations under state law.
AMOUNT: City of Pittsburgh (and as of 2023, Allegheny County) align campaign contribution limits with the FEC. As of late January, these limits increased and are now $3,500 for Individuals and $5,000 for Committees. A candidate or committee can follow up with applicable donors and request the difference between the old limit and new. Note a lower limit applies to subordinate City employees/contractors, as detailed below.
TIMING: Contribution limits relating to the public (non-City employees and contractors) are tied to the election cycle. Each election cycle starts the date after the last covered election for the desired seat. For 2025 City of Pittsburgh races, the last covered election is the general election, because no special election occurred. The election cycle will conclude on the date of the primary election. Then, a new election cycle begins for the few months between the primary and general elections.
INCUMBENTS: Additionally, City of Pittsburgh employees/contractors may be limited to contributing $100 (or $200 for department heads) depending on the elected office. This limit only applies to incumbents and their subordinates - for example, employees/contractors of the Controller are subordinates of the Controller and their restriction would not apply to contributions for Council or Mayor; similarly, DPW is part of the executive branch, therefore subordinates of the Mayor and their restriction would not apply to the Controller or Council. The contribution limit extends for the prior four-year consecutive period, as detailed in§ 197.04. A recent advisory opinion issued by the Board found that the limit of $100/200 also applies to City of Pittsburgh professional service contractors who are acting as employees.

Education

The Ethics Hearing Board regulates conduct under state and city ethics laws.
NOTE: Legal issues can be multi-faceted and you may have rights or obligations beyond the ethics laws within the Ethics Hearing Board's jurisdiction.

Conflicts of Interest

Conflict violations occur when a public servant misuses their government position to create a private gain to themselves, their family, or to a business/organization/property associated with that public servant or their family.
When there is an intersection of a City official/employee's public role and their (or their family's) private interests, it is possible a conflict may arise. In every instance of a conflict, our public servants are required to disclose the interest, and refrain from participating in any deliberations, decisions, or actions related to the matter -- the Ethics Officer is available to help manage conflicts through our Request Advice service.

Gifts

Gifts are restricted from “Interested Parties” -- this includes (1) individuals who have or seek a financial relationship with the City; (2) those who are involved in lawsuits against the City or are otherwise adverse legal parties (3) those who have a substantial interest that could be affected by the performance or nonperformance of the public servant’s official duties.

Use of Position

Public Officials and employees are prohibited from using their title or position in connection with any private business from which they receive compensation.

Use of City Resources

Personal use of city resources is prohibited – City facilities, property, staff, equipment, information, and funds must be used solely for official city business.

Post-Employment Restrictions

The ethics code outlines restrictions for separating employees and officials which are in effect for twelve months following the end of employment or service.

Nepotism

Hiring and Appointment: The code prohibits officials and employees from promoting, hiring, supervising, or appointing relatives (or allowing a relative to be under their chain of command) unless a waiver is obtained from the Ethics Hearing Board.

Disclosures

Officials and employees are required to file financial disclosure statements.


- Statement of Financial Interests:Due annually by May 1: Each public employee or official must file the SOFI for each year they are employed by the city. The Ethics Officer is available to assist with questions on completing and filing the form.
- Statement of Affiliations:Parties entering into contracts with the city valued at $1,000 or more must complete the statement of affiliations.
- Disclosure of Interests:Elected officials must complete this form filed with the Controller’s Office each January.
Other disclosures required by the Board include Campaign Finance Disclosures, Gift Disclosures, and Conflict Disclosures

Outside Employment

Honorarium: Payment to public servants for speeches, presentations, appearances, and published works are forbidden unless payments are both (1) legitimate consideration for the value of such services; and (2) undertaken in the public servant’s private professional capacity and not related to the public position.
Prohibited Financial Interests: The city ethics code has a strong ban on any city employees or officials from receiving any direct or indirect financial interest or ownership interest in a city contract. It’s also unlawful to receive a financial interest from any party having dealings with the city. The Board is in charge of interpreting, applying, and administering this strict restriction and can issue waivers upon a review of the specific facts and circumstances involved.
Multiple Government Employment: The Board may soon have the authority to help employees and officials navigate the Charter’s restriction on multiple government employment.

Political Activity

The city law applies restrictions on holding elected office as a public official. Employees are prohibited from engaging in political activity during working hours. It is also unlawful to engage in political activity at any time on or with city property. Additionally, employees cannot be compelled to contribute to a political campaign and are limited to contributing no more than $100/$200 to their employer over a four-year term.

Campaign Finance

The Board regulates candidates, candidate committees, those making independent expenditures, and others, requiring early reporting, and compliance with the contribution limits as set out by the Federal Election Commission.

Urban Redevelopment Authority

The URA administers Federal and Commonwealth grants designed to provide a broad range of urban renewal and maintenance programs within the City. The Authority also coordinates efforts to improve the economic vitality, the housing stock, and overall living conditions within the City. The URA has a five-member board; each member is appointed by the Mayor.

Housing Opportunity Fund

The Housing Opportunity Fund (HOF) was created in 2016 (via City Council Ordinance #37). The HOF was established to support the development and preservation of affordable and accessible housing within the City.
For the administration of the fund, Authority staff is working with a 17-member Advisory Board that was appointed by the Mayor and approved by City Council in June 2018. According to the HOF enabling legislation, the Advisory Board will work with URA staff to create and approve an annual allocation plan which outlines proposed funding levels by programmatic category. The Advisory Board will then recommend approval of the allocation plan to the URA Board of Directors, the Governing Board, for final approval. Once the URA Board of Director’s approves the allocation plan it will be presented to City Council.
On September 6, 2018, the Advisory Board approved the followingallocation plan(PDF, 30KB). The plan includes five programmatic areas: Rental Gap Financing, Owner-Occupied Rehab, Down Payment Assistance, Acquisition/Rehabilitation/Resale of Vacant and Abandoned Properties, and Homeless Rental Assistance.

Brief Descriptions of Proposed Programs


Homeless Rental Assistance

Service providers may apply for funding to provide short term rental assistance (maximum 1 year) and associated services to households at or below 30% and/or 50% AMI who are homeless or at risk of homelessness. Rental assistance may include fixed monthly shallow subsidy or declining balance subsidy. Homeless rental assistance also includes eviction prevention services such as legal assistance.

Rental Gap Funding

The Rental Gap Funding Program will provide secured loans for the new construction and/or preservation of affordable rental units. For projects in the development process that have units serving households at or below 30 and/or 50% AMI, developers may apply for secured loans for acquisition and construction, or renovation/preservation, of rental housing projects. Developers may also apply for funding for resident supportive services to be delivered with the project.

Owner-Occupied Renovation (OOR)

The Owner-Occupied Renovation Program will address unsafe and unhealthy conditions in homes owned by homeowners with incomes at or below 30%, 50% AMI, and/or 80% AMI. Non-profits may apply for funds for renovation and associated services, or households may apply directly to the URA. Examples of eligible repairs are new roofs, furnace replacement, weatherization repairs, and/or accessibility modifications. The Owner-Occupied Renovation program also includes funding for homeowner services such as tangled title assistance, estate planning, and foreclosure prevention.

Down Payment and Closing Costs

First time homebuyers with incomes up to 115% of AMI may apply to the URA for down payment and closing cost assistance for the purchase of a house in Pittsburgh.

Development of For-Sale Housing

The Development of For-Sale Housing Program will expand the pool of quality for-sale housing affordable to households at or below 80% AMI. Developers may apply to HOF for costs associated with the development of residential property including acquisition, rehabilitation, or new construction, and soft costs associated with the property development. Funds will help bridge the gap between total development cost and the future sales price. Funds may also be used in the form of deferred second mortgages for the future homeowners. The homeowners must reside in the property.
