The Food Program Division of Citiparks is a unique and wonderful opportunity to provide for our City’s youth. We offer 2 different programs: After-School Food Program (CACFP--Child and Adult Care Food Program) and Summer Food Service Program (SFSP, more affectionately known as GrubUp). These programs provide after-school food service as well as a summer food program to ensure nutritious eating for all! Both of these food programs are available to all children up to 18 years old, as well as intellectually disabled individuals up to 21 years old.
