Neighborhood Employment Centers (NEC’s)

The NECs help to ensure that employment services are made available to those residents who might otherwise not receive it. The City of Pittsburgh has historically supported up to six (five currently) geographically dispersed community-based organizations which operate Neighborhood Employment Centers (NECs). The Centers provide essential employment services to City residents such as job placement assistance, job development, educational referrals, employment workshops, employment referrals and employment counseling. Presentations on relevant topics such as healthcare, workforce survival skills, job readiness and employment and education trends are also available. Local employers, including the City of Pittsburgh, conduct interviews regarding open roles and positions. Centers also provide a limited set of educational programs.

Classification & Compensation Study

As part of our efforts to modernize the HR function, we identified the need to overhaul and update the classification and compensation system, which was originally implemented in the late 1970s. A classification and compensation system provides the framework for determining how employees will be paid. As a general rule, most public entities conduct new classification and compensation studies periodically to ensure their ability to hire and retain qualified employees and that internal relationships are equitable. The periodic review which comes with a comprehensive classification and compensation system update also enables an organization to account for technology changes, changes in work processes, tools and equipment, and other factors that can affect job responsibilities.
In order to properly maintain a classification and compensation system, an on-going process is needed to review job responsibilities and job class assignment to pay grades to ensure jobs are properly classified and compensated. To support this effort, Human Resources and OMB collaborated on an RFP, through which Segal Waters Consulting was selected. The firm has decades of experience performing similar projects in local governments across the country, and the firm understands the value and importance of a positive working relationship while managing a study of this nature.
