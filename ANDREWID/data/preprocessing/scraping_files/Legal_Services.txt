Right to Know

On January 1, 2009, a new Right to Know Law (the "RTKL") took effect in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Under this statute, public records of the City of Pittsburgh are generally available to citizens who request them.
The following outlines the basic provisions of the RTKL and the procedures for making a request for records:

Public Records

The Right to Know Law defines a public record as information, regardless of physical form, which documents a transaction or activity of the City, and that is created, received or retained pursuant to law or in connection with a transaction, business or activity of the City. A record is not a public record if:


- It is exempt from disclosure under Section 708(b) of the RTKL; or
- It is exempt from disclosure under any other Federal of State law, or regulation or judicial order or decree; or
- It is protected by a privilege.
Generally, public records are to be open for inspection or duplication in accordance with the RTKL. Records are to be provided in the medium requested if they exist in that medium. Otherwise, they are to be provided in the medium in which they exist. The RTKL does not require the City to give computer access to any requester.
When responding to a request, the City is not required to create a record that does not presently exist. Nor is the City required to compile, maintain, format, or organize a record in a manner in which the City does not currently maintain, format, or organize the record.

The Law Department is the office that accepts Service of Process of Legal Papers (e.g., Writs, Injunctions, Complaints, etc.) on behalf of the Mayor and the City of Pittsburgh. This office does not accept service of legal papers for any individual City employee other than the Mayor.
Any individual City of Pittsburgh employee, except for the Mayor, must be served with legal papers at their assigned duty location or office.
Further, the Law Department does not accept service for any Authorities of the City of Pittsburgh (e.g., The Pittsburgh Water & Sewer Authority (PWSA), the Housing Authority of the City of Pittsburgh, the Pittsburgh Parking Authority (PPA), or the Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA)). These Authorities are wholly separate and distinct from the City of Pittsburgh.
Service of Subpoenas on individual City Departments and employees must be served at the office where the employee is assigned and/or the records are located. A convenience copy of the subpoena should be provided to the Law Department.

Disruptive Properties

The Mayor’s Office of Equal Protection enforces and ensures compliance with Chapter 670 of the City Code, the Disruptive Properties ordinance. Disruptive commercial properties threaten the health, safety, and welfare of the residents of the City of Pittsburgh and burden its public safety services. When owners repeatedly violate the law by permitting illegal activities onsite or failing to properly maintain their commercial properties, the City may take action against them.
Such action is reserved for repeated, unabated offenses. A commercial property may be designated as Disruptive pursuant to Chapter 670only aftera single felony violation or at least three citations for disruptive activity.Neighbors disturbed by properties in disrepair are advised to contact theCity’s 3-1-1 Response Centerto initiate a complaint.
Designation as a Disruptive Property has serious consequences. The Public Safety Director is authorized to charge the property owner for all costs of law enforcement or public services called to a Disruptive Property. When a property violation remains unabated for an unreasonably long period of time, misdemeanor charges may also result.

Office of Municipal Investigations


What We Do

The Office of Municipal Investigations (OMI) is responsible for coordinating the receipt, analysis and investigation of citizen complaints of misconduct alleged against employees of the City of Pittsburgh. This includes uniformed personnel such as Fire , Police, EMS, and Building Inspection employees.

About OMI

OMI is not the only office that investigates complaints against officers of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police. TheCitizen's Police Review Board (the "CPRB")also accepts complaints against police officers. The CPRB is an independent agency that is empowered to investigate allegations of police misconduct and hold public hearings at which complainants, witnesses and police officers must appear.
Due to their overlapping authority, OMI and the CPRB may both investigate the same complaint of misconduct. Unlike the Citizen's Police Review Board, OMI must investigate all complaints against theBureau of Policeand must have its findings accepted by the Chief of Police.
