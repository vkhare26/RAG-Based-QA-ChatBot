Pittsburgh History

Pittsburgh was called the "Gateway to the West" from its earliest days as a frontier village.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Introduction to Pittsburgh

Easily navigable waterways with an abundance of natural resources, (coal, timber, natural gas, iron and limestone) helped Pittsburgh become the industrial center for a growing nation.

Most people recognize one thing about Pittsburgh's history, that it was known as an industrial hub for coal mining and steel production.

Pittsburgh has played an important part in

U.S. history

from the early days of the French and Indian War (1758), to the Revolutionary War (1776), to the infamous

Whiskey Rebellion

(1791) and the American Civil War (1860s) with its secretive

Underground Railroad stops

.

The Civil War boosted the city's economy with increased iron and armament demand. With his introduction of the Bessemer steel making process, Scottish immigrant Andrew Carnegie, completed his rise from obscurity to become the richest man in the world. Carnegie began steel production in 1875.

Henry Clay Frick

, grandson of western Pennsylvania whiskey distillers, made his fortune building and operating beehive coking ovens where coal was turned into coke, a necessary raw material in steel making. Soon, the two men came together to form the Carnegie Steel Co. In 1901, Carnegie and Frick merged several companies into

United States Steel Corp

.

The history of America's labor union movement added some dark days during the

Homestead Steel Strike

and subsequent armed conflict of the

Battle of Homestead

. From these dark days, though, grew modern labor practices and laws to protect workers.

While the riverfront

steel mills of the Mon Valley

are mostly gone now, the generosity of industrial giants like Carnegie and Frick, food manufacturer H.J. Heinz, and banker/financier Andrew Mellon lives on in a legacy of art, culture and education in Pittsburgh. What remained are the Frick family home, known as

Clayton

, as well as a masterful art collection. Andrew Carnegie's generous public donations included

The Carnegie Library

,

Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh

, and Carnegie Institute of Technology (known today as

Carnegie Mellon University

).

Up through the mid-1950s, Pittsburgh was the nation's eighth-largest city, accounting for nearly half of national steel output. The city's population swelled to over a half million with European immigration via Ellis Island. Pittsburgh's patchwork of

neighborhoods

still retains an ethnic character reflecting the city's immigrant history.

Even though Pittsburgh faced rough times in the 1970s and 80s when steel production all but disappeared from its landscape, it has since re-invented itself as a hub for

education

,

medicine

, small manufacturing and research. Of course, having extremely successful

sports teams

has enhanced the city's reputation. The black and gold of all three of its professional teams,

Steelers

(NFL),

Pirates

(MLB) and

Penguins

(NHL) are synonymous with the pride local residents have in its sports teams and the city they represent.

Today Pittsburgh welcomes visitors from around the globe. Its strengths lie in its authenticity as an all-American city, and its genuine, hard-working and welcoming sense of community that has transformed it into one of the most surprisingly beautiful and progressive cities in the USA.

The Pittsburgh “H”

The Pittsburgh “H”

Truly, "Pittsburgh" might be America's most misspelled city. It is one of the few U.S. cities or towns to be spelled with an "h" at the end of a burg suffix.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Naming of Pittsburgh

Originally Fort Duquesne, the earliest known reference to the new name, Pittsburgh, is in a letter sent from General John Forbes to William Pitt the Elder, 1st Earl of Chatham, dated November 27, 1758. This letter notified Pitt that his name had been given to the place, spelled "Pittsbourgh." In the city charter, granted on March 18, 1816, the Pittsburgh spelling is used on the original document, but due to an apparent printing error, the "Pittsburg" spelling is found on official copies of the document printed at the time.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pittsburgh Loses Its "H"

In 1891 the United States Board on Geographic Names adopted thirteen general principles to be used in standardizing place names, one of which was that place names ending in -burgh should drop the final -h. At this time the city's name was rendered "Pittsburg."

The Board supported its decision to rename Pittsburgh by referencing the printed copies of the 1816 city charter which featured the spelling Pittsburg rather than Pittsburgh. Based on those copies, the Board claimed that the official name of the city had always been Pittsburg. However, the members of the board seem to have been unaware that the original 1816 charter specified the name of the city to be Pittsburgh, and that only the copies of the charter featured the erroneous spelling "Pittsburg."

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The "H" is Back!

The new official spelling was resisted by many people in the city. The Pittsburgh Gazette refused to adopt the Board's decision, as did the Pittsburgh Stock Exchange and the University of Pittsburgh. Official city documents continued to use the old spelling. Responding to mounting pressure, the Board reversed the decision on July 19, 1911, and the Pittsburgh spelling was restored after 20 years of contention.

Many cities across the United States named after the city of Pittsburgh, such as Pittsburg, Kansas, and Pittsburg, California, continue to use the "Pittsburg" spelling in their names. Other independent municipalities, such as the borough of East Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, reflect the modern spelling.

For three decades was the composing and arranging partner of jazz great Duke Ellington. Met Ellington in 1939 outside the Stanley Theater, now the Benedum Center; where the bandleader hired him immediately and the two worked together until Strayhorn died in 1967. His compositions alone or with Ellington include "Lush Life," "Chelsea Bridge," "Johnny Come Lately," "A Flower Is a Lovesome Thing" and "Satin Doll."

Warner Brothers

Harry, Sam, Albert and Jack Warner hailed from Ohio but made a name for themselves by opening the first silent movie nickelodeon in downtown New Castle in 1907. Granddaugher Cass Warner today holds a film festival in New Castle and has started the Harry M. Warner Film Institute at Slippery Rock University.

The Vogues

Harmony-pop vocal group formed in 1960 by lead baritone Bill Burkette, baritone Don Miller, first tenor Hugh Geyer, and second tenor Chuck Blasko, who were all high school friends from Turtle Creek. Originally dubbed the Val-Aires, the foursome eventually reached the number four spot in the autumn of 1965 with "You're the One." Most memorable hit, the classic "Five O'Clock World," cracked the Top Five. Two more Top 40 entries, "Magic Town" and "The Land of Milk and Honey," followed in 1966. Resurfaced in 1968 with the Top Ten smash "Turn Around, Look at Me." The single, the Vogues' lone million-seller, anticipated the lighter, more sophisticated approach of subsequent hits like "My Special Angel," "Till," and "No, Not Much." Various Vogues lineups continue touring oldies circuits.

The Skyliners

Pittsburgh vocal group made it big with a magnificent heartache ballad in 1959, "Since I Don't Have You," among R&B's greatest hits. Led by vocalist Jimmy Beaumont, with Janet Vogel, Wally Lester, Joe VerScharen, and Jackie Taylor. Legend has it that Janet ad libbed the song's memorable ending in high C (after repeating thirteen "you's") as a joke during rehersals. The group liked it so much they made it a permanent part of their arrangement. More than a dozen labels rejected the song before it was released by a local Pittsburgh label, Calico Records. Their follow-up, "This I Swear," peaked at number 20 on the R&B charts.

In recent years, The Skyliners created not one, but two Christmas standards. The group's version of the Beaumont/Rock compositions "You're My Christmas Present" and "Another Lonely New Year's Eve" are not only heard across America each holiday season, but have been included on a number of holiday compact disc collections. The ensemble was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2002.

The Mellon Family

Andrew W. Mellon expertly invested money into multiple industrial and financial ventures including steel, aluminum, coal, utilities, railroads, banks, and more. Developed his father’s bank into Mellon National Bank which aided in the transformation of Pittsburgh into an industrial giant. Mellon Institute for Industrial Research was created by A.W. and brother Richard in 1909 in an effort to fund research in promotion of better business and scientific practices. A private man who kept his early philanthropy quiet, like canceling small debts for Christmas and purchasing food and clothing for people in Pittsburgh. Named Secretary of the Treasury in 1921 and served as Secretary for Presidents Harding, Coolidge, and Hoover, cutting the national debt with what was known as the "Mellon Plan" and authored the book Taxation: The People’s Business. Resigned in 1932 and accepted the position of U.S. Ambassador to Great Britain for one year. After retirement, began his largest philanthropic quest, the National Gallery of Art in Washington, DC. Collected works while Secretary but solidified his plans with the A.W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust in 1930. Following the announcement of the Gallery, personal collection neared 350 pieces from which 121 paintings and twenty-one sculptures were added to the Gallery collection. Also established a trust to fund the Gallery, donating $10 million, as well as giving an estimated $21 million in art and $15 million for the construction of the Gallery building.The grand opening occurred in 1941 after his death. The legacy of A.W. Mellon remains with the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation philanthropic trust formed in 1969 through the merger of the Avalon Foundation (est. 1940 by Ailsa Mellon Bruce) and the Old Dominion Foundation (est. 1941 by Paul Mellon). Prior to the merger, the Avalon Foundation distributed funds to hospitals and health agencies, educational institutions, and cultural programs including the Metropolitan Opera and the New York Philharmonic. The Old Dominion Fund concentrated on the humanities and liberal education. The merged foundation, with assets of $3.4 billion (1998), continues to support the areas of health, education and the humanities and has added programs in conservation, public affairs and population studies.

The Lettermen

Founding member Tony Butala began singing professionally as a boy in Sharon and by the age of eight appeared on Pittsburgh's KDKA Radio. Moved to Hollywood to become a member of the famous Mitchell Boys Choir, appearing in motion pictures, television and radio and concert tours. In the mid-fifties, while still in high school in Hollywood, Butala formed The Fourmost, a vocal group of three ex-Mitchell Boy Choir friends and a female classmate, Concetta Ingolia. After moderate local success, Ingolia exited the group to be cast in a new TV series, "Hawaiian Eye," and chose the stage name Connie Stevens. By 1960, The Lettermen—now Butala, Jim Pike and Bob Engemann—were signed to Warner Brothers Records and released their first single: "Their Hearts Were Full of Spring."

In 1961, Capitol Records signed them to what turned out to be an over twenty-five year contract. The Lettermen first hit the music charts in 1961 with "The Way You Look Tonight." Following that first hit with another chart topper, "When I Fall In Love." Made "Theme From A Summer Place," "Smile," "Our Winter Love," "Come Back Silly Girl" and "Graduation Day." Late 1967 made perhaps their most loved and requested hit: the medley of "Goin' Out Of My Head / Can't Take My Eyes Off You." In 1967, Engemann left the group and was replaced by Jim's younger brother, Gary Pike. Hits continued with "Up, Up And Away," "Hurt So Bad," "Shangri-La," "Put Your Head On My Shoulder" and "Love." In 1973, when Jim left the group, the youngest Pike brother Donny took over and hits like: "Cherish / Precious and Few," "World Without Love," "If You Feel The Way I Do," "Feelings," "What I Did For Love," and Donny's own "Thank You Girl."

Throughout the 70s, 80s and 90s, The Lettermen continued to release albums and travel the world, performing hundreds of concerts each year. The current Lettermen consist of Tony Butala (the group's only original member), Donovan Scott Tea (an accomplished singer and songwriter who joined the group in 1984) and Darren Dowler (a young actor, singer, impressionist who came aboard in 1995). The year 2000 marked the group's 40th Anniversary. Butala created the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in Sharon, dedicated to honor the greatest vocal groups in the world.

The Heinz Family

Howard Heinz, son of founder H.J. Heinz, bequeathed his residual estate to the Howard Heinz Endowment for philanthropic purposes. Today thanks to the largesse of both Howard and Vira Heinz Endowments, a variety of arts and culture, social service, healthcare, environmental, economic development and educational services thrive in Pittsburgh and around the world.

Henry Heinz II was an active community leader with intense interest in the arts worked toward citywide revival and the creation of a downtown Pittsburgh cultural district. In 1971, together with funding from the Heinz family, oversaw the creation of Heinz Hall for the Performing Arts, the home of the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra. Founded the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust in 1984. Spearheaded the creation of the Heinz Gallery, located in the Carnegie Museum of Art, in 1988, and the development of the Benedum Center, a two-year restoration of Pittsburgh's historic Stanley Theater.

His son, the late Senator John Heinz, as chairman of the Heinz Charitable and Family Trust and trustee of the Howard and Vira Heinz Endowment, continued the Heinz family tradition of combining entrepreneurial skill with community activism.

Stephen Foster

Famous for writing songs like "Oh! Susannah" (1848), "Camptown Races" (1850), "Old Folks at Home" (1851), "My Old Kentucky Home" (1853) and "Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair" (1854). Not understanding his musical talent, his pioneer family provided little formal musical education. His knowledge of African Americans was drawn from minstrel shows for which many of his songs were written. Feeling that prejudice against these 'Ethiopian songs' existed, he was at first unwilling to risk his reputation by having his name appear on them. Had little aptitude for business, and his income was never commensurate with the popularity of his songs. Excessive drinking and extreme poverty ruined his last years. He died in Bellevue Hospital, New York City. Buried in Allegheny Cemetery, Section 21, Lot 30.

Stanley Turrentine

Born to a musical family, father Thomas played tenor saxophone, mother played piano, brother Tommy the trumpet and brother Marvin drums. Stanley played tenor sax, mixing jazz with blues, rock, rhythm and blues and pop. In the 50's, played with Lowell Fulson, Earl Bostic, and Max Roach's bands. In the 1960s, worked with organist Jimmy Smith and made many soul jazz recordings both with Smith and as a leader. Had his biggest hit "Sugar" in 1970. Then turned to jazz fusion, but returned to soul jazz in the 80's and 90's. Career began in Pittsburgh and came back to his roots for his final journey. Buried in Allegheny Cemetery, Section 26, Lot 722.

Stan Musial

One of the game's great hitters, St. Louis Cardinal "Stan the Man" won the National League batting championship seven times (1943, 1946, 1948, 1950–52, 1957) and the league's Most Valuable Player award three times (1943, 1946, 1948). In 1963 retired with a lifetime batting average of .331. Hit 475 home runs and for many years held the National League record for base hits (3,630). Elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1969.

Shirley Jones

Shirley grew up in Smithton, PA, where grandfather William B. Jones founded the Jones Brewery in 1907 that's still in operation. She was a gifted child with natural singing ability, studied under Ralph Lewando, one of Pittsburgh's top vocal coaches.

After graduating from South Huntingdon High School, she was spotted by a scout photographer for The 1952 Miss Pittsburgh Pageant and went on to compete for the title of Miss Pennsylvania. The prize was a two year scholarship to the drama school at the Pittsburgh Playhouse. She planned to go on to college but instead went to New York City in the summer of 1953. There she was discovered by Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein who cast her as Laurie in the 1955 movie version of their hit stage musical Oklahoma!

Later Shirley played the same role on Broadway and established a career in both theater and the movies, including the musicals The Music Man (1962) and Carousel (1956). The actress won a 1960 Academy Award for her portrayal of a prostitute in the film Elmer Gantry. From 1970-74, starred on the TV show The Partridge Family as Shirley Partridge, the mother of a rock act who also sang in the band and co-starred her real-life stepson, early '70s heartthrob David Cassidy.

Most memorable hit, the classic "Five O'Clock World," cracked the Top Five. Two more Top 40 entries, "Magic Town" and "The Land of Milk and Honey," followed in 1966. Resurfaced in 1968 with the Top Ten smash "Turn Around, Look at Me."

The Skyliners

Pittsburgh vocal group made it big with a magnificent heartache ballad in 1959, "Since I Don't Have You," among R&B's greatest hits. Led by vocalist Jimmy Beaumont, with Janet Vogel, Wally Lester, Joe VerScharen, and Jackie Taylor. Legend has it that Janet ad libbed the song's memorable ending in high C (after repeating thirteen "you's") as a joke during rehersals. The group liked it so much they made it a permanent part of their arrangement. More than a dozen labels rejected the song before it was released by a local Pittsburgh label, Calico Records. Their follow-up, "This I Swear," peaked at number 20 on the R&B charts.

In recent years, The Skyliners created not one, but two Christmas standards. The group's version of the Beaumont/Rock compositions "You're My Christmas Present" and "Another Lonely New Year's Eve" are not only heard across America each holiday season, but have been included on a number of holiday compact disc collections. The ensemble was inducted into the Vocal Group Hall of Fame in 2002.

Documented black Pittsburgh and created a historically and sociologically accurate record of its African-American history from 1931 through 1975. Nicknamed "One Shot" by Mayor David L. Lawrence because of his habit of snapping only one shot of him when other photographers would shoot many. Died at the house where he had lived for most of his life at 89, two weeks shy of his 90th birthday. Both the Westmoreland Museum of American Art in Greensburg and the Carnegie Museum of Art have held exhibitions of his photographs, with the Carnegie creating a special archive for the work.

Billy Eckstine (1914–1993)

His smooth baritone and distinctive vibrato broke down barriers throughout the 1940s, first as leader of the original bop big-band, then as the first romantic black male in popular music. Began singing at the age of seven and entered many amateur talent shows. Was hired by fellow Pittsburgher Earl "Fatha" Hines to join his Grand Terrace Orchestra in 1939 and by 1943, gained a trio of stellar bandmates—Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker, and Sarah Vaughan. After forming his own big band that year, he hired all three and gradually recruited still more modernist figures and future stars including Dexter Gordon, Miles Davis, Fats Navarro, and another Pittsburgher, Art Blakey. The Billy Eckstine Orchestra was the first bop big-band, and its leader reflected bop innovations by stretching vocal harmonics into normal ballads.

Hit the charts often during the mid-'40s, with Top Ten entries including "A Cottage for Sale" and "Prisoner of Love." Made the transition to string-filled balladry with ease and recorded more than a dozen hits during the late '40s, including "My Foolish Heart" and "I Apologize."

Morgan for $480 million and devoted the rest of his life to his philanthropic activities and writing. Was perhaps the first person of wealth to state publicly that the rich have a moral obligation to give away their fortunes.

In 1889 wrote The Gospel of Wealth, asserting that all personal wealth beyond that required to supply the needs of one's family should be regarded as a trust fund to be administered for the benefit of the community. Set about disposing of his fortune through innumerable personal gifts and through the establishment of various trusts. In his thirties, gave his first large gifts to his native town. Later created seven philanthropic and educational organizations in the United States, including Carnegie Corporation of New York. Established network of free public libraries to make available to everyone a means of self-education.

Sites of the Underground Railroad

Sites of the Underground Railroad

The Underground Railroad was undoubtedly one of the most significant forms of activism in our nation's history.

It was broad in its reach, encompassing the United States and beyond, and profound in its meaning for a nation entwined in the sale of human life. Yet, that history, by its very secretive nature, is a difficult one to reveal.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What was the Underground Railroad?

Western Pennsylvania was a major thoroughfare for enslaved peoples seeking freedom. They followed routes that were carved by nature in rivers, streams and mountains, traveling mostly on foot, with an occasional ride in hidden compartments of wagons and other forms of transportation. Their numbers are not certain as formal records were not kept and few informal ones remain. Some documents written by those who assisted—sometimes referred to as the "conductors"—in this underground process have survived, giving some indication of what those traveling on the railroad endured. Some publications written by, or for, those who managed to survive to secure their freedom also exist.

Free people of African decent who lived in the area were also affected by the Fugitive Slave Laws, fleeing their homes as they faced the possibility of becoming enslaved. Still others became the voice of social change and self-empowerment for all Blacks of the era and beyond. The

history

is unique and boundless.

Explore more than 250 years of African-American history in the

Senator John Heinz History Center's

exhibition,

From Slavery to Freedom

, which highlights the history of the anti-slavery movement, the Underground Railroad and the impact of 19th-centurty activism on the quest for civil rights in Pittsburgh.

One of the many Underground Railroad routes in western Pennsylvania came in through Uniontown in Fayette County, then traveled through Blairsville in Indiana County before continuing into Mercer, Venango and Erie Counties.

The

Blairsville Area Underground Railroad Project

provides tours of the town and cemetery and UGRR-related sites, including the Underground Railroad Museum.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Demolished Sites

Allegheny Institute and Mission Church

Later known as Avery College, then as Avery Memorial A.M.E. Zion Church at Nash and Avery Streets. Charles A. Avery came to Pittsburgh in 1812. His interest in the cotton industry took him on buying trips to the South, and he was drawn to the plight of the Negro slaves. Joining the abolitionist forces, he aided the escape of slaves from the South to Canada in the underground railroad.

The Allegheny Institute and Mission Church, later known as Avery College, built with funds from Mr. Avery's fortune, was a three-story structure heavily influenced by the Greek Revival architecture being used in many eastern cities at that time. The basement, accessible by hidden trap doors, was most probably a "station" (hiding place) in the secret Underground Railroad. A tunnel from the church's basement led to a former canal nearby, permitting fugitive slaves to be dropped by boat from the Allegheny River. A rowboat was used to secretly move them up the canal at night to the tunnel entrance. The first and second floors were used for education, and the third floor for religious purposes.

When Avery died, his fortune was estimated at $800,000. Among the bequests was $20,000 for Oberlin College, the first college in the United States to admit Blacks. Workmen demolished the red brick building of Avery College in Old Allegheny's Dutchtown to make way for the much disputed highway through the East Street Valley. Outside of a few sentimental old-timers, nobody noticed the demolition of the old structure. But to the old-timers, the passing of the building meant the end of a prominent Pittsburgher's dream.

Crawford Grill

A center of Black social life, located in the Hill District, where musicians such as Art Blakey, Mary Lou Williams and John Coltrane drew a racially mixed, international clientele. Owned by William "Gus" Greenlee, a powerful figure in politics and sports in Pittsburgh's Black community, who owned the Pittsburgh Crawfords, the city's Negro League baseball team.

Monongahela House

Demolished hotel, once located at the corner of Water and Smithfield Streets. One of the city's finest hotels and a center of anti-slavery activity. Its staff included 300 free Blacks that had daily contact with a flow of wealthy Southern businessmen who came north and east.

Point View Hotel

Family-owned historic bar and restaurant on Brownsville Road in Brentwood, that once served as a stop on the Underground Railroad. Runaway slaves stayed in the basement.
