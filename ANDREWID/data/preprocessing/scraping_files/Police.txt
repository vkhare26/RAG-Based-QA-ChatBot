What is Pittsburgh Police Cares?

Pittsburgh Police Cares is an online resource to help community members connect directly with Pittsburgh Police officers who work in their neighborhoods.
By visiting the Pittsburgh Police Cares link for your police zone, you can find upcoming community events and alerts, monthly and annual crime statistics, and the names and email addresses for the officers in each sector of the zone so you can ask for them by name.
This allows residents and community members to connect with officers on a first name basis to request a police presence for events, report crimes or disturbances, and ultimately create stronger community/police partnerships built on familiarity and mutual trust.

Pittsburgh's Department of City Planning Announces Zoning Amendments

Today, the Gainey Administration and City of Pittsburgh’s Department of City Planning (DCP) announced a series of zoning reforms designed to increase and diversify Pittsburgh’s housing supply, lower housing costs, and provide opportunities for residents of all income levels to find housing they can afford in neighborhoods across the city.
These proposed changes are an outcome of the 2022 Housing Needs Assessment, which provided several recommendations on land use and zoning regulations that, when implemented, have successfully led to reinvestment and population growth in cities across the country.
"I'm excited to see the City of Pittsburgh introduce this suite of zoning code updates.  Throughout my All In Allegheny transition process we heard from residents all over the county who wanted to see more housing options near transit and tools for updating and modernizing zoning to support affordable housing development.  Today's introduction is a key first step in this work and I look forward to working with all 130 municipalities throughout Allegheny County on common sense zoning updates that can help create more homes for our neighbors," said County Executive Sara Innamorato.
“We’ve known for a long time that many Black and Brown residents have been forced out of our city due to the rising costs of housing,” said Mayor Ed Gainey. “We can’t call ourselves a welcoming city if we aren’t constantly working to make housing attainable and affordable for those who live or want to live in our city. These amendments are a huge step in the right direction.”
The primary changes include:
Transit-Oriented Development Zoning Changes
Transit-oriented development creates opportunities for a greater density of housing units near public transportation options to provide residents with easy, affordable access to jobs and services. In Pittsburgh, only 37% of the land within ½ mile of fixed guided transit (busways, trains) is zoned to allow for multi-family development. This proposal would amend the zoning map at Herron Avenue Busway Station, South Hills Junction, and Chartiers Avenue Busway Station (Sheraden Station) to allow for multi-family development around these transit stations.
Accessory Dwelling Units City-Wide
An Accessory Dwelling Unit (ADU) is an additional, or accessory, residential space on an existing property commonly known as backyard cottages, granny flats, or in-law suites. This amendment would allow for an independent dwelling unit within a primary structure, detached structure, or an existing accessory structure (i.e. a garage or basement).
Parking Reform
The proposed ordinance will simplify the existing Zoning Code by removing minimum parking requirements for developments and various permitted reductions in parking requirements. This will allow for greater ease in reusing existing buildings, reduce the cost of new development and re-development, and shift focus to more transportation options.
Minimum Lot Size Reform
This proposed change would remove the minimum lot size per unit, or the minimum lot area needed to develop a residential unit. This would remove a barrier that prevents housing projects from reaching the maximum number of units otherwise allowed by the zoning code, increasing the city’s housing supply and lowering the cost of housing.
Inclusionary Zoning City-Wide
Currently, the City of Pittsburgh has Inclusionary Zoning Overlay Districts in Lawrenceville, Bloomfield, Polish Hill, and the majority of Oakland. This proposed amendment would expand this city-wide, which requires new or renovated developments with 20+ units to affordably price 10% of the total units for individuals at or below 50% of the Area Median Income (AMI) as established by the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD).
“It’s time that we modernize our zoning code to better reflect our changing city. These reforms will remove barriers to the construction of new housing developments that provide safe, affordable housing options for Pittsburghers of all income levels and improve multi-modal transit options and streetscapes. Ultimately, we’re working towards a city that meets the housing needs of all its residents,” said DCP Director Jamil Bey.
These proposed zoning amendments are available for public comment through November 5th. Residents may provide feedback on EngagePGH, or in person at a series of Development Activities Meetings that will be held throughout September and October 2024.
Once the public comment period has closed, these changes will be presented to the Planning Commission for hearing and recommendation before presenting to City Council in early 2025.
For more information on these amendments and opportunities to provide comment, please visitEngagePGH.

Pittsburgh Bureau of Police Make Operational Changes to Better Serve Pittsburgh

Pittsburgh, PA. Beginning Monday, February 26, 2024, Pittsburgh Bureau of Police personnel will transition from traditional eight-hour work days, back to four 10-hour shifts each week, with three consecutive days off.
This organizational change is designed to enhance officer wellness, a key pillar in Chief Scirotto’s priorities for the Bureau.
“An additional day away from work each week to focus on family, friends, or outside pursuits is key to creating a healthy workforce and contributes to the Bureau’s goal of not only recruiting new officers, but retaining them for the long haul, ” said Chief Larry Scirotto. Officers will also be afforded one hour of wellness time each week while on shift to use at their discretion.
In addition to the revised work schedule, the Bureau is making additional adjustments to more effectively serve Pittsburgh residents and visitors to the city.
Some of the changes are as follows:


- Centralized deployment established for the night shift where police units will be strategically placed throughout the zones staffed by multiple supervisors and a night watch commander who will oversee operations and allocate resources to areas of need throughout the city
- New watch commander added to the p.m. shift
- Formation of the Violent Crime Division to include Homicide, Narcotics, Intelligence, and the Violence Prevention Unit with the overarching goal of reducing violent crime and gun violence
- Installation of blue phones with a direct line to 9-1-1 outside all six police zones and the Downtown Public Safety Center for use between 3 a.m. and 7 a.m. when officers are deployed in the field
- Creation of an enhanced Telephone Reporting Unit (TRU) operating from 7-3 a.m. daily, including weekends. Dispatch will assign reports to the TRU for calls that do not require an in-person response by officers. TRU will NOT be assigned to any “In Progress” call where a suspect may be on scene, any crime where a person may need medical aid, any domestic dispute, calls with evidence, or where the Mobile Crime Unit will be requested to process a scene
- Creation of thePittsburgh Police Caresportal on the City of Pittsburgh website modeled on the current Zone 1 Cares initiative. The online portal will be one-stop shopping for police/community engagement events, safety alerts, monthly crime statistics, and zone/neighborhood-centered news
- Online citizen reporting
“Following thorough audits of how police resources were being allocated, these improvements are backed by data to ensure that the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police is serving the city in the most efficient and responsible manner, placing the primary focus on areas of concern to enhance quality of life in our neighborhoods, improve community/police partnerships, and prioritize officer wellness. These are my key priorities for the Bureau, which will only serve to strengthen public safety in the city,” said Scirotto.

Spring Hill was named for its hilly topography, panoramic view of the city, and natural underground springs. Spring Hill is located north of downtown Pittsburgh. It is adjacent to Interstates 279, 579, & Route 28, and it is five minutes from downtown Pittsburgh. It’s out-of-the way location, easy access to highways, low crime rate, abundant greenery, and value of tradition all translate into a desirable area for families to raise their children and for elderly to live safely. This community is nestled on the hilltop; it is one of the North side’s best-kept secrets. Its German ethnic roots have evolved to neighbors of diverse races, economics, and social status, which make Spring Hill a truly unique community. Contact us to learn how to get involved.

Fineview Citizens Council (FCC) and Perry Hilltop Citizens Council (PHCC) began collaborating in the winter of 2016. This partnership was started in large part by the redevelopment of Allegheny Dwellings. FCC and PHCC realized this development project would have a large impact on our communities and that we did not have the capacity to respond to it, nor did we have a comprehensive community plan to inform the development.
Since that time, our two organizations have done quite a bit of collaborative work. We even raised funding to hire two full-time staff members.
FCC and PHCC are currently in the process of collaborating to produce a joint comprehensive community plan that will inform future neighborhood development and put forward a shared vision for our communities. Contact us to learn how to get involved.

The Zone Three Public Safety Councilwas formed in the late 1970’s as the Zone 3 Police - Citizen’s Council with the mission “to serve as a vehicle for the exchange of ideas, information and advice so communities may work together for solutions to problems of mutual concern; and to develop more effective and efficient communication community and the Bureau of Police. “
Today, with a new name, we continue serve as a bridge between residents and public safety personnel. Working together keeps us that when we work together, we are Safer Together.
We host open, general meetings monthly. Meetings are both informational and solutions oriented.


- Guest speakers address a topic of interest to Zone 3 residents
- Zone 3 police, elected officials, and department of public safety representatives attend to assist in resolving issues.
- Neighbors share their experiences and news about their communities.
- Residents leave meetings with a sense of the services available as well as what next steps are to be taken to resolve the issue.
We support the development of neighborhood public safety groups and activities (i.e. block watches) believing that each community, neighborhood, block or groups of blocks has the responsibility to identify and help maintain quality of life and public safety concerns.
Each year we select a primary project that will benefit all communities in Zone 3, that can be completed with the year, and that is sustainable over time.

We are a non-profit, volunteer run organization made up of people who care for, and are invested in the beautiful neighborhood of Point Breeze North.
If you live here, are a business owner, or own property here, we encourage you to get involved, make an impact, and stay connected.
Point Breeze North received its name from the Point Breeze Hotel, which was located along the Greensburg Turnpike during the early 1800s. This area is now the intersection of Fifth and Penn Avenue.
McPherson and Thomas, the major streets, emulate French boulevards, with wide, divided roads, floral islands, and a mixture of apartments and mansions. It remains as it was then: an area of distinctive and mixed historical styles, from Civil War row houses to 1920s villas, to Victorian gingerbread homes. Westinghouse Park derived its name from the Westinghouse mansion that was in North Point Breeze since its beginning.

Pittsburgh


Transitions

Pittsburgh was founded on November 25, 1758. Early on, Pittsburgh played an important role in our country’s history. In the early 1800s, the city became known as the “Gateway to the West.” This nickname referenced the huge advantage Pittsburgh had by having the intersection of three major waterways. The Allegheny River and Monongahela River join together at what is known as the “point” to form the Ohio River. This intersection opened the gates for Pittsburgh to lead the way in the trade industry for products such as coal, timber, natural gas, iron and limestone. By 1911, Pittsburgh manufactured half of the nation’s steel. Due to the amount of pollution given off by the steel factories the city had a new nickname - “The Smoky City."
Throughout the years, Pittsburgh has made multiple changes and overcome many obstacles. The city has moved from the steel industry to healthcare, education, technology, and financial services. What were once heavily polluted streets are now clear due to the restrictions on factories. Companies such as Google, RAND, PNC and Highmark have emerged and are now calling Pittsburgh home.

Population Statistics

Pennsylvania is the sixth largest populated state in the United States. Pittsburgh is the second largest city in Pennsylvania and has an estimated of 310,000 people. The population consists of 51.9% females and 48.9% males, with the average age being 33.


- Caucasian = 66%
- African American = 26%
- Asian = 4%
- Hispanic = 2%

Community

The City of Pittsburgh offers everything a person might be looking for in a home, with its wonderful shopping areas, great restaurants, and beautiful views. The Strip District is a wonderful market spot known for its variety of food and an excellent shopping with unique stores. The neighborhood known as Shadyside is another fantastic region of Pittsburgh to find trendy shops and restaurants. If you’re looking for authentic homemade Italian food, Bloomfield or “Pittsburgh’s Little Italy” is the place for you. If you’re looking for more of a creative and artistic side of Pittsburgh, pass through the neighborhood of Lawrenceville.
East Liberty is known as for business and industries. Looking for a fun night out on the town? Southside has a fun and exciting nightlife full of clubs, sports bars, and laid back pubs. Wanting to catch a game or spend some quality time with your loved ones? The North Shore or North Side is the place to be. Mt. Washington is the high point of Pittsburgh; it gives the residents of Pittsburgh and tourists a beautiful view of this magnificent city. Finally, Downtown, like most downtown districts, has great food, dining, parks, plazas, and art museums.

Sports Teams


Steelers

Arthur J. Rooney founded the famous football team, the Pittsburgh Steelers on July 8, 1933 . Since then, the team has won seven AFC Central titles and four AFC championships. They also became the first NFL team to win four Super Bowls and are the only team to ever win back-to-back Super Bowl twice. They now have six Super Bowl wins, with the most recent happening after Super Bowl XLIII.

Penguins

Pittsburgh was honored to become the home of the Penguins in 1967. Mario Lemieux, the team's current owner, played for the team from 1984 to 2005. The Penguins have appeared in the playoffs 28 times, won their division eight times, and earned the President’s Trophy in 1993. The Penguins have won the Stanley Cup four times as well, with the most recent championship happening in 2016.

Pirates

The Pirates are the oldest professional sports team in Pittsburgh. The team played their first National League game on A pril 30, 1887, defeating the Chicago White Stockings. In 2007 Robert Nutting, a native from West Virginia took over as owner. The Pirates have won their division eight times and the National League Championship nine times. They have won the World Series five times, most recently in 1979.

Cultural Activities

Pittsburgh has some of the greatest attractions in Pennsylvania. If you’re looking for a fun place to bring the family, the Carnegie Science Center and SportCenter is an excellent choice. There, children will gain education by exploring and entertaining themselves through programs in technology, sports, and science. The Pittsburgh Zoo & PPG Aquarium is another popular site for families. There are also fantastic museums and educational centers such as the Andy Warhol Museum, Pennsylvania Trolley Museum, the Carnegie Museum of Art, Carnegie Museum of Natural History, and Senator John Heinz Pittsburgh Regional History Center.
All of these places offer amazing history and ancient artifacts. Pittsburgh also has some of the most talented performers to have ever graced the stages of the Benedum Center, Harris Theater, Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, and Heinz Hall for the Performing Arts. These are all must see attractions in Pittsburgh.

Education

The University of Pittsburgh, Duquesne University, Carlow University, Point Park University, and Carnegie Mellon University are just a few universities located in the City of Pittsburgh. There are even more outside the city such as Robert Morris University, Washington & Jefferson, and La Roche College.

Shopping

Pittsburgh is home to some of the greatest shopping locations. Shadyside shopping is a 3-block stretch of retailers that range from less familiar specialty shops to popular brands on the well-known Walnut Street. Across from the Monongahela River is the famous Station Square complex that offers not only amazing shopping center, but also terrific dining and excellent entertainment. The South Side Works is another trendy shopping area that is a must visit; most shops and boutiques are located on the famous East Carson Street.

History of the Badge

In 1873, the Police Badge was designed and officially adopted by the City of Pittsburgh. The badge is a unique design: The crest is from the Coat-of-Arms of William Pitt, the first Earl of Chatham, and the man for whom Pittsburgh is named. The garter around the badge is linked to King George III, the last English ruler of the American colonies. The shield is a circular fighting shield used by 15th century Greek foot soldiers. During the 16th and 17th centuries, the circular shield was used extensively in the British Isles, hence its appearance in Pittsburgh. The Pittsburgh Police Badge with its distinctive design and history is worn with great pride by the men and women of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police.

Policies and Procedural Manual

City of PittsburghBureau of PoliceOffice of the Chief“honor, integrity, courage, respect, compassion”
All policies are issued and signed by the Chief of Police. The policies have been put in place to ensure ethical and professional conduct on the part of the men and women of the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police; to ensure equitable and constitutional enforcement of law; and to ensure that all members are dedicated to the principles of Procedural Justice:


- Voice
- Neutrality
- Respect
- Trustworthiness
Our proud participation in the National Initiative for Building Community Trust & Justice has solidified our long-held belief that our legitimacy as law enforcement is contingent upon many factors, including transparency. The Pittsburgh Bureau of Police believes strongly in being transparent. Transparency fosters trust.
To achieve transparency, we believe that it is important that we provide the public with the opportunity to review our policies with regards to how your Police Officers may interact with the community.
Police work is unpredictable. There is no all-encompassing formula for dealing with every facet of human behavior or situation that law enforcement encounters on a daily basis. The Manual of Procedural Orders establish guidelines for the performance expected by all members of the Police Bureau. It is my belief that with these guidelines, our officer’s training and our desire to serve the public trust, we will professionally serve all residents and visitors to our wonderful city.

Policy Redactions

Regarding policy redactions:
Listed below are the reasons some policies may feature redactions:
- Confidential or internal phone numbers, emails, and web addresses used by members of the Police Bureau.

Fallen Officer


A Part of America Died

Somebody killed a policeman today,And part of America died.A piece of our country he swore to protect,Will be buried with him at his side.
The suspect that shot him will stand up in court,With counsel demanding his rights.While a young widowed mother must work for her kids,And spend many long lonely nights.
The beat he walked was a battle field toojust as if he had gone off to war.Though the flag of our nation won't fly at half mast,To his name they will add a gold star.
Yes, somebody killed a policeman today,In your town or mine,While we slept in comfort behind locked doors,A cop put his life on the line.
Now his ghost walks a beat on a dark city street,And stands at each new rookies' side.He answered the call,of himself and gave his all,And a part of America died.
