Street Sweeping

In the spring season of each year, the Department of Public Works (DPW) starts its Street Sweeping Program. The goal of the Street Sweeping Program is to maintain Pittsburgh's streets on a regular basis by either machine sweeping, hand cleaning, or flushing.

Schedule

Street Sweeping begins April 1 and ends November 30.The schedule is adjusted based on weather conditions.
Business Districts are normally cleaned at night, this is to avoid disrupting normal business activity while taking advantage of parking restrictions.
Neighborhood and residential street sweeping begins after 8 AM and ends approximately at 2:30 PM.

Services

The program offers four levels of service.
Level 1:Heavily developed commercial business districts with considerable vehicular and pedestrian traffic.


- Streets will be swept and flushed at least twice per week.
Level 2:Neighborhood business districts and main streets with moderate vehicular and pedestrian traffic.


- Streets will be swept or flushed once per week.
Level 3: Residential areas with limited throughway and pedestrian traffic.


- Streets will be swept once or twice per month.
Level 4: Neighborhood streets which are used for local purposes only.


- Streets will be swept or flushed two to four times per year.
Public Works administration staff closely monitors the street sweeping program's effectiveness to assure that the maximum amount of service is being executed, in addition to the program goals being satisfied.

Disaster Response

The City of Pittsburgh is prone to natural events and disasters, including:


- Floods
- Severe winter storms
- Drought

Pittsburgh Paving Program

The City of Pittsburgh’s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure is excited to announce the 2023 Paving Season. Street resurfacing work is scheduled all over the City, so please see theresurfacing schedulewebpage to find upcoming work in your neighborhood.

How is the yearly paving list created?

Criteria for Street Selection
The Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) works with community groups, council members, and 311 to identify potential issues in the right-of-way regarding street surface conditions. DOMI's staff and engineers create a yearly list based of off the following criteria:


- Street Overall Condition Index (OCI)- Every street in Pittsburgh has an OCI score based upon the physical condition. Once the condition of the street deteriorates past a certain threshold it is given additional priority on the yearly paving list.
- Street Use- Streets are broken into three categories: Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary. Primary roads receive the most use, which results in their OCI score dropping more quickly than Secondary or Tertiary.
- Equity- We apply this metric to the paving list to ensure that tax dollars are applied in a fair and impartial way so that streets in neighborhoods with a higher need receive an increase in their OCI score.

How do I report a street or road related issue?

To request service or ask a question regarding paving in your area please proceed to the311 Response Centerand fill out the online form. Please provide the location, select the service typeRoads/Street Issues, and provide a brief description of the issue you've identified or the question you have.

Potholes

Report a Pothole to 311
A pothole occurs when there is a small failure in the road surface, and if left unattended, it will start to degrade the road surface.
Pothole patching is a year-round activity which is performed by the Maintenance Divisions. Each of the Area Divisions is responsible for handling all the pothole patching complaints and requests that are received in their respective areas. Each has one or two asphalt crews that perform the work.
Some examples of the work crews perform include:


- Pothole patching.
- Roadway gutter installation and/or repair.
- Windrow installation or repair.A "Windrow" is an asphalt curb placed along the side of the street to aid in drainage.

Road Safety


Traffic Calming

DOMI’s Neighborhood Traffic Calming Program aims to increase the safety and comfort of people traveling by all modes through a neighborhood by reducing excessive motorist speeds on residential neighborhood streets.

Autonomous Technology

Autonomous technologies have the potential to assist the City in achieving shared & autonomous mobility principles.

Traffic Calming

DOMI’s Neighborhood Traffic Calming Program aims to increase the safety and comfort of people travelling by all modes through a neighborhood by reducing excessive motorist speeds on residential neighborhood streets.DOMI has recorded dataat all their Traffic Calming Project locations.

What Traffic CalmingIs

Different types of traffic calming are appropriate on different types of streets – most often it involves physical safety improvements such as speed humps, speed cushions, speed tables, raised crosswalks, pedestrian islands, traffic circles, changes to lane widths, chicanes, etc. These measures have been proven to reduce speeding and increase safety. Typically, speed humps, speed cushions, and speed tables are the most common traffic calming measures on our streets given their effectiveness in managing vehicular speeds, but other measures can be proposed if they are deemed more effective on a given street.

What Traffic CalmingIsn't

The City’s Neighborhood Traffic Calming Program focuses on lower-cost measures effective at slowing vehicular speeds and/or volumes on residential streets. The program does not consider larger-scale solutions to traffic congestion nor speeding on higher-volume arterial streets. Instead, the Neighborhood Traffic Calming program is a community-driven, block-by-block solution to address speeding on local, residential streets.
In addition, traffic calming does not include the use of regulatory measures such as stop signs. Stop signs designate right-of-way for drivers at intersections and can only be installed if certain warrants are met. DOMI gives careful consideration to the installation of stop signs as they are frequently ignored if not warranted. Unlike traffic signals or stop signs at intersections, which do not reduce mid-block speeds, traffic calming measures encourage slower vehicular speed along the length of a block rather than at intersections.
If you have traffic-related or pedestrian safety issues at a particular intersection, these concerns are best communicated with the DOMI through the city’s 311 system.

Eligibility and Prioritization

To be considered a potential project under the Neighborhood Traffic Calming Program, a street first must pass DOMI’s initial Eligibility Screen. To be eligible under this program, the street must meet the following criteria:


- Be owned by the City of Pittsburgh;
- Have a maximum of two travel lanes if two-way street and one travel lane if one-way;
- Be a local street or collector;
Applications passing the initial Eligibility Screen will be evaluated by staff for their speed and volume of traffic. If the application passes the Speed Threshold (85th percentile speed must be 5 mph or more than the posted speed limit), then staff will score the street using the following engineering criteria as well as the DOMI Equity Index:


- Speed;
- Volume;
- Crash history;
- Pedestrian generators (transit stops, schools, senior centers, etc.); and
- Presence of sidewalks.

Request Neighborhood Traffic Calming

As of September 2023, requests for traffic calming can be made through a newrequest portal.
The map-based system integrates the eligibility requirements outlined above and provides status updates on requests.

DOMI Review Process and Timeline

If your street passes the Eligibility Screen, staff will collect speed and volume data. The turnaround on this data collection will depend on how many applications come in each month. Streets that meet the speed threshold are placed on the eligible list, and DOMI staff score the projects on this list using the prioritization criteria.
Note:Even if your street meets all of DOMI’s eligibility criteria and is on the list of potential projects, it still may not be selected for the final list of traffic calming projects. DOMI receives limited funding for the Neighborhood Traffic Calming Program each year and can only select a handful of projects to construct. However, your street will remain on the list of potential projects the following year.
If your street is selected for a traffic calming project, the resident who submitted the application and their council district will be notified before traffic calming elements are installed.
If you have any further questions about the Neighborhood Traffic Calming Program, please email us attrafficcalming@pittsburghpa.gov

Frequently Asked Questions


What data is used for traffic calming evaluations?

Motorized vehicular volumes and speeds (mph), number ofreportedcrashes in a 3-year period, number of pedestrian generators within 1-2 blocks, presence of sidewalks, neighborhood equity score, connection to existing plans

What are the measures of success for the program?

Reduction in reported crashes, reduction in volume, reduction in vehicular speeds (85th percentile). Visit ourTraffic Calming Datapage for more information and data about the successes of this program.

Why wasn’t there a public meeting for this project?

Traffic Calming Applications are submitted to us by your neighbors and fellow residents. The City will always inform the public of changes to roadways, but reserves the right to make safety improvements which have been deemed necessary and which will be beneficial to the greater good, even without input from the public. Public meetings usually occur if the project scope makes changes to parking or traffic operations (one-way conversions, diverters, etc.)

Will this project affect parking?

Reductions in on-street parking are possible depending on project scope, however, for most projects that include speed humps or tables there will be no changes to on-street parking. Drivers may park on top of a speed hump or table. During construction, it may be necessary to temporarily prohibit or reduce parking. Temporary no parking signs would be installed in advance.

Can a stop sign be installed to slow people down?

No. The MUTCD (Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices) states that stop signs shall not be used as a means of traffic calming/speed reductions. Stop signs shall be used to designate right-of-way.

How do speed humps/tables/cushions affect emergency services and transit?

There is a minimal degradation of response time (usually measured in seconds) of EMS and transit vehicles associated with the presence of speed humps and tables. The Department coordinates projects with Public Safety and Pittsburgh Regional Transit. On primary emergency response routes identified by Public Safety, DOMI deploys speed tables for speed control measures. Speed tables are similar to speed humps but with a modified flat top that raises the entire wheelbase of a vehicle to reduce its speed which creates a more undulating traffic calming measure.

People are parking on the sidewalk, what can be done?

City code prohibits vehicles from parking or stopping on sidewalks. These infractions are ticket-able offenses and should be reported to the Pittsburgh Bureau of Police or the Pittsburgh Parking Authority.

Autonomous Technology


Pittsburgh’s Shared + Autonomous Mobility Principles

Autonomous technologies have the potential to assist the City is achieving these principles. However, these technologies are still in the development, testing, and piloting phases. While there are many potential benefits of autonomous technologies, including improved safety and accessibility, there are also potential consequences, including sprawl and congestion. Pittsburgh is working to shape the development of autonomous technology and policy to achieve our mobility goals and avoid unintended consequences. In order to do this, we are allowing certain entities to test autonomous technologies on our streets and sidewalks.
From 2018 to 2023 the City of Pittsburgh participated in an initiative sponsored by the Knight Foundation to support autonomous mobility pilot projects, with the intended goal of engaging local residents around new mobility technologies to ensure that they reflect community input and meet local needs. In both engaging with the public in Pittsburgh and sharing findings with other cohort cities like Detroit, San Jose, and Miami, DOMI was able to develop a more robust and comprehensive understanding of what makes projects work (or not work), the effects of various policies, and how to develop relationships with the public and industry when dealing with autonomous technologies. The City of Pittsburgh contributed its findings to CityFi and UrbanismNext for development of itsAV Guidebook.

Autonomous Vehicles

An autonomous vehicle is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and moving safely with little or no human input. In Pittsburgh, all AV Testers are testing Level 4 autonomous driving systems as defined by the Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE), which means that the vehicle is capable of performing all driving functions under certainconditions. While early applications mostly focused on the development of a robo taxi service model, there has been a noticeable growth in interest in autonomous trucking, with Pittsburgh’s own Aurora making a pivot to develop in this space.
In recent years, many testers have moved to use their own private test courses for the bulk of their testing. In 2022, House Bill 2398 setup Pennsylvania’s regulatory framework around autonomous vehicles and moved authority over autonomous technologies to the state level, withPennDOT now the authority managing issues related to autonomous vehicles in Pennsylvania.
This move coincided with PennDOT’s development of thePennsylvania Safety Transportation and Research Track (PennSTART)with the goal of providing a best-in-class facility in Southwestern Pennsylvania focused on modernizing and enhancing the training for first responders while also having a space for developers and manufacturers of autonomous technologies to test and refine their products.
Adjacent to RIDC Westmoreland’s site in Mount Pleasant, the state-of-the-art training and testing facility will focus on the transportation safety, research and operational needs of the region by focusing on six key areas:


- Traffic Incident Management
- Connected and Autonomous Vehicles
- Tolling, ITS and Traffic Signals
- Work Zones
- Commercial Vehicles
- Transit Vehicles
- Autonomous Technologies

Personal Delivery Devices (PDDs)

Under state law, a personal delivery device means a ground delivery device that is manufactured for transporting cargo or goods; is operated by a driving system that allows remote or autonomous operation, or both; and weighs less than 550 pounds without cargo. These devices may operate on sidewalks, shoulders, and bicycle lanes. State law gives PennDOT the authority to authorize a personal delivery device provider to operate in the state. In order to operate a personal delivery device in the City of Pittsburgh, a company mustsubmit an application to PennDOTand receive authorization.

Current Personal Delivery Device Operators

Thanks to the support of the Knight Foundation, DOMI held a pilot program with PDD operator Kiwibot in Bloomfield. The pilot was intended to provide city staff and residents experience with personal delivery devices (PDDs) in order to create informed local policies before the widespread deployment of PDDs. As a part of this work, extensive knowledge sharing and communication with other cohort cities took place. Urbanism Next published areport on the findings across cities, and a more localized report on Pittsburgh’s experience can be found atengage.pittsburghpa.gov/pdd-pilot.

Future Partners

The City is interested in exploring partnerships and shared research agendas in the following areas:
- Vehicle Technology focused on Pittsburgh’s unique environment
- Experimentation with connected transportation infrastructure
- Research and Engagement with the public on autonomous mobility and workforce implications
- Research and experimentation with how autonomous technologies could fill Pittsburgh’s transportation gaps or supplement our existing transportation network
