Tribute to Mary Cardwell Dawson

Mary Cardwell Dawson (1894 – 1962) was a trailblazer in the world of opera and classical music. This gifted opera singer and music educator served as the founding force behind the National Negro Opera Company. Dawson was committed to improving opportunities for African American musicians, particularly in the opera world, where Black artists faced significant discrimination.
Her vision for the NNOC was to create a space where African Americans could perform opera at the highest level and gain the same recognition and opportunities as their white counterparts.  She believed that opera was a powerful medium through which African American culture could be showcased and celebrated.

The National Opera House: Restoring a Legacy

The National Opera House (NOH) is a non-profit organization dedicated to restoring, preserving, and maintaining the historic home at 7101 Apple Street in Pittsburgh. This landmark building served as the birthplace of the National Negro Opera Company (NNOC), the first permanent African-American opera company in the nation.

Park Maintenance

The Department of Public Works is responsible for the daily maintenance and repair of Pittsburgh's park system. Around 100 laborers within our six Parks Divisions care for 163 public parks.
We work in cooperation with CitiParks, the Department of Public Works' Forestry Division, and the Department of City Planning on tree maintenance, major park and playground upgrades, master plans, and donor initiated projects. Pittsburgh's historic parks have a wide variety of amenities, monuments, fountains, courts, fields, and more.
Over a century after Director of Public Works Edward M. Bigelow became known as the "father of our parks" for his ambitions park acquisitions, the department works daily to ensure these assets remain a gem of our community for the next century.
Please submit all maintenance requests to the311 Response Line.

Parks FAQ


Do I need a permit to use park facilities?

It would be best to acquire a permit to ensure your use of the facility (field, court shelter) and to inform the maintenance personnel. Per PGH Code 475.02 Groups of 25 people or more who want to picnic are allowed only in locations for that purpose. To rent facilities see City of Pittsburgh'sonline registration website.
Normal operating hours are from 6:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m.; however, some facilities do close at sunset.

Are dogs allowed in the parks?

Yes, but the dog must be on a leash at all times, unless utilizing one of the Off-Leash Exercise Areas (OLEA'S). Dogs are not allowed in playgrounds or courts at any time. (Ordinance 473.05b)
