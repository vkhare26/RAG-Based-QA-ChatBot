Frequently Asked Questions


What can I do to help keep Pittsburgh litter free?

Volunteer to help clean it up! If you organize a clean-up within the City of Pittsburgh, the Department of Public Works will provide supplies and pick up of all collected refuse. If you’re not able to physically pick up litter yourself, there are ways to help your neighborhood when they organize clean-ups, such as coordination, organization, or providing refreshments to other volunteers.
Studies have shown that having litter on the ground prompts more people to throw litter down than they would in an area with no litter. Regular clean ups to keep areas well-maintained stops future litter from happening.

What is illegal dumping?

Illegal dumping is the improper and criminal act of disposing or abandoning municipal waste including (but not limited to) household waste, construction & demolition waste, tires, furniture, appliances, mattresses, electronic waste, etc. at roadsides, open areas, vacant lots, private property, hillsides, and greenspaces. Illegal dumping is an intentional act done to avoid responsibility of proper waste disposal.

My organization / neighborhood association / school / etc wants to do more; can the City provide a specialist to talk with us?

Yes we do! Please contactvolunteer@pittsburghpa.govand we can arrange for a meeting with our Anti-Litter Specialist, Recycling Specialist, or Environmental Enforcement Coordinator to suit the needs of your community.

How should waste be disposed of properly to avoid illegal dumping?

All bulky waste not currently maintained by Environmental Services must be taken to a contracted transfer station approved by Allegheny County Municipal Solid Waste Management plan. For more information, please see ourBulky Waste Resources Page.

How do I report illegal dumping?

If youseeillegal dumping happening currentlyin the act… Call 911!
If youfindillegal dumpingafter the fact... Call 311!
We can fight against illegal dumping by being told thewho,what,when, andwhereas it happens.


- Who:License plate number and make and model of vehicle used for dumping materials
- What:Description of materials dumped
- Where:Location such as street address or parcel ID#
- When:Time and date of when dumping occurred OR when it was first discovered
(If you see illegal dumping occurring, please do not confront the individual(s) and jeopardize your safety.)

There is a “We Buy Houses” sign on a utility pole, am I allowed to take it down?

Yes! We consider these illegal bandit signs placed on utility poles “litter on a stick,” which can be taken down by anybody. If you are not able to take it down safely yourself, you can report it to 311 for DPW removal.

How can I request a public trash can placement to combat litter in my area?

You can request a trash can placement through our 311 Service Request system. The City has a limited number of trash cans it is able to service at any given time, but it is often willing to move an existing can to somewhere it can be put to better use. When requesting a trash can, please remember that we may not be able to place it at your desired location due to many potential factors such as safety, ability to service, abuse of trash cans place at location in the past, etc.

I would like to volunteer to use skilled labor to install a public amenity (e.g. garden, benches, signs, trail, etc.). How can I do this?

Please contactvolunteer@pittsburghpa.govand describe in detail the type of work you would like to perform. Public amenities require many levels of approvals and considerations and we want to work to find the best way to move forward together.

How does illegal dumping hurt my community?

Illegal dumping is a costly crime of convenience that negatively affects both local residents and all Pittsburgh taxpayers. While properly disposing of the waste material would cost the dumper on average $60 per ton, the amount of effort it takes to clean up a dump site after the fact costs on average $600 per ton! These clean-up efforts takes away from using these funds and resources on other valuable DPW work, like filling potholes, emptying refuse cans, maintaining our parks, etc.
Illegally dumped material is a risk to public health, and pollutes surrounding wildlife, environment, and our iconic waterways. The blight of dumping reduces quality of life and property values for residents, while also further encouraging additional dumping, littering and other crimes.

What is the penalty for illegal dumping?

Illegal dumping can result in fines of up to $10,000.

Plastic Bag Ban & Paper Bag Fee


Why ban plastic bags and mandate a fee for paper bags?

The City of Pittsburgh is committed fostering a clean and sustainable community by reducing waste and litter. In April 2022, Pittsburgh City Council unanimously passed an ordinancebanning plastic bagsand requiring at least10¢be charged for paper bags.
Plastic bags are problematic through their lifecycle - they are made from non-renewable resources, often used just once, are hard to recycle, and do not biodegrade. They litter sidewalks and parks, clog storm drains and recycling machinery, and contaminate soil and water with microplastics. Paper bags, while recyclable, are still resource-intensive to produce and studies in other cities show that charging a fee decreases their use.
This webpage is intended to provide information to the public and help businesses ensure they are compliant with the ordinance. We encourage you to read it thoroughly, utilize the available resources, and reach out if you need assistance. Have questions?See FAQs.




Who does the ordinance apply to?

The plastic bag ban and paper bag fee apply to all businesses that meet the following criteria:

Common Customer Questions, Answered

Businesses keep the fee in order to help them recoup any additional costs associated with providing paper bags to customers. Some businesses, like those that have already factored in the cost of paper bags, may decide to donate the required 10¢ fee to a local non-profit.
You can avoid paying the paper bag fee by bringing your own bag to the store or restaurant, or opting not to receive a bag.
Reusable bags can be used safely with basic cleaning practices. You should wash your reusable bags to keep them clean and prevent bacteria from accumulating.
Customers can contact the City of Pittsburgh 311 Response Center to report a business that is out of compliance.

Litter Index

While we know that litter is a problem for Pittsburgh, quantifying that problem can be very challenging. In order to know if our efforts are improving the amount of litter on the ground, we first need to know just how much litter is on the ground to begin with.
We've recently completed our first test of the pilot program for the Litter Index! Click the page below to see our report on what the Litter Index is, what it found about our streets, and how we are looking to expand in the future!
