Pittsburgh Skyline

Pittsburgh's skyline is full of architectural and cultural history. Visit the Fort Pitt Block House, Frick Building and many more during your visit.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Downtown

Allegheny County Courthouse and Jail Complex

Stunningly beautiful. Singularly graceful. A symphony of arches. Considered by many to be the leading architect of the 19th century, Henry Hobson Richardson's 19th century neo-medieval design combines stunning brickwork and crisp granite detail. An outdoor fountain in the courtyard park highlights the magnificent riverfront structure, while the Bridge of Sighs (mirroring the Venice original) --at one time used to transport prisoners--connects the Courthouse to the former jail. What Richardson considered his best work remains among elite architectural company in Pittsburgh's Golden Triangle.

BNY Mellon

Born out of a merger between The Bank of New York and Mellon Financial Corporation, The Bank of New York Mellon has a substantial Pittsburgh presence. It's the oldest banking corporation in the nation - tracing its roots back to Alexander Hamilton. BNY Mellon Center is 55 stories and was completed in 1983. It is the second-tallest building in the city, boasts an eight-sided design and a rooftop heliport. On a clear day it is possible to spot the building from as far as 50 miles away.

Fort Pitt Block House

The Block House is the oldest structure in the City of Pittsburgh and the last vestige of the British Empire, built here in 1764 by the English Army. Much of its original fabric is still intact and it is open and free to the public year-round as an historic landmark. The Block House is the focal point in Point State Park where the three rivers of Pittsburgh, the Allegheny, the Ohio and the Monongahela, meet.

Frick Building

The Frick Building (1901-02), the first of industrialist Henry Clay Frick's architectural ventures on Grant Street, Downtown. In 1903, Leslie's Weekly judged it "the finest office building in the world," and no wonder: Daniel Burnham gave the coke and steel king a vertical version of the White City, a neo-classical tower with a dazzling white, T-shaped marble lobby, clean and crisp as a new dollar bill; bronze lions flanking the entrance; and John La Farge's stained glass window, "Fortune and Her Wheel," above a marble bust of Frick installed after his death in 1919.

Fifth Avenue Place

Home to Highmark, Pennsylvania's largest health insurer, Fifth Avenue Place was completed in 1988 and has 31 floors. The structure is made of a unique granite frame for roughly 450 feet and then collapses inward in a pyramid shape for another 124-foot-tall roof structure. Protruding from the top of the skyscraper is a 178-foot-tall mast. Despite its rounded appearance, the 13-story structure is actually 12-sided and measures four feet in diameter.

Gulf Tower

Rising 44 stories above the Downtown skyline, the Gulf Tower beacon glows different colors according to weather conditions. Built as the headquarters for the Gulf Oil Company, the structure was completed in 1932. The crown of the skyscraper is modeled after the Mausoleum of Halicarnassus in the style of the step pyramid. The building was listed as a Pittsburgh History & Landmarks Foundation Historic Landmark in 1973.

K&L Gates Center

K&L Gates Center is one of the major distinctive and recognizable features of downtown Pittsburgh. The building, long known as One Oliver Plaza and briefly as FreeMarkets Center and Ariba Center, was completed in 1968, has 39 floors and rises 511 feet above downtown Pittsburgh.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Omni William Penn Hotel

Built in 1916, this grand hotel boasts a history as one of the architectural centerpieces in downtown Pittsburgh. Unique features include the historic filigreed arches cradling the main lobby space, elegant lanterns that once again grace the sidewalk. Enlarged in 1929 by architect Benno Janssen and his partners, the hotel lobby has Old World elegance, with its potted palms, crystal chandeliers and classical music. The hotel's finest room, however, is on the 17th floor -- the Art Deco ballroom designed by New York architect Joseph Urban. The hotel is the last of four buildings in three adjacent blocks commissioned by industrialist Henry Clay Frick, who sometimes reserved the Presidential suite for his own use.

Oxford Centre

One Oxford Centre is actually a complex of six buildings, all of matching glass and steel design. Completed in 1983, One Oxford Centre has 46 floors in its main tower and rises 615 feet about Downtown. The tower has nearly 1.5 million square feet of office and high-end retail space. At night, 43 spotlights illuminate the Centre with a total of 55,000 watts that create a glowing effect said to be greater than any other high-rise in the U.S. The building is designed the way it is, with so many sides, because the developers wanted as many corner offices in it as possible.

PNC/Fairmont Tower

Headquartered in Pittsburgh, The PNC Financial Services Group is one of the nation's largest financial services companies. Three PNC/Fairmont is a 23-story skyscraper and is one of the nation's largest mixed-use LEED-certified green buildings. It's also the site of one of the largest "living walls" in North America. Included is the green 185-room Fairmont Pittsburgh Hotel, as well as 28 luxury condos. The company is at work on The Tower at PNC Plaza, which is expected to be the world's largest green high-rise.

PPG Place

Beautiful PPG Place is the headquarters for PPG Industries, Inc. and perhaps the most distinctive building in Pittsburgh's picturesque skyline. PPG Place, a large building complex including a 40-story tower (635 feet) with five satellite buildings that cover a six city block area, was designed by Philip Johnson and John Burgee. The large urban complex was in part inspired by two existing architectural landmarks in Pittsburgh, the Cathedral of Learning in the University of Pittsburgh's campus and H.H. Richardson's Allegheny County Courthouse.

In PPG Place, Johnson made loose use of Gothic architectural vocabulary, translating it into modern materials and construction techniques. PPG Place stands perhaps as one of Johnson's buildings that best demonstrate his wit and affinity for mixed messages. By mixing historical forms with modern methods of construction, Johnson created a post-modernist building which is truly unique, in part due to its use of materials, which were immensely appropriate since PPG is a leading manufacturer of curtain wall assemblies.

Union Trust Building

Formerly known as the Union Arcade (1915-1917). The architect of this Flemish Gothic fantasy was Pittsburgher Frederick J. Osterling, who had enlarged Frick's Point Breeze home two decades earlier. It is Frick's answer to the then-new Woolworth Building in New York City, the world's tallest. When it opened, it was Pittsburgh's most sumptuous shopping mall, although its four floors of shops have been reduced to one. Step inside, walk to the center and look up into the delicate lace of the stained glass dome.

U.S. Steel Tower

Designed by Harrison & Abramovitz, the world headquarters of the U.S. Steel Corporation was completed in 1971. During the initial planning stages, the U.S. Steel Corporation seriously considered making this development the world's tallest building. The tower's shape, mirroring the shape of Downtown Pittsburgh, is a triangle with indented corners. It was the first building to use liquid-fireproofed columns. At the time of its completion this was the world's tallest building outside of New York and Chicago, and is still the tallest building in Pittsburgh at 64 stories. When its construction was completed in 1971, the building was considered to be an engineering masterpiece. The Tower is home to the global headquarters for both the U.S. Steel Corporation and UPMC, a leader in innovative health care practices and a health insurance provider.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mt. Washington

Chatham Village

Built in the early 1930s, Chatham Village is a model planned community with rowhouses, garden courts, greenbelt and recreation facilities opened through the Buhl Foundation to promote social reforms and housing improvements for middle-income families. This influenced the development of 20th century urban planning in the US.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Oakland

Cathedral of Learning

The Cathedral of Learning is the centerpiece of the University of Pittsburgh's main campus in Oakland. Standing at 535 feet, the 42-story Cathedral is the tallest educational building in the western hemisphere and the second tallest in the world. The Cathedral was commissioned in 1921 and finished in 1937, and has 2,529 windows.

Nationality Rooms

The first and third floors of the Cathedral of Learning are home to 29 Nationality Rooms. As gifts to the University of Pittsburgh from the city's ethnic communities, these 30 unique classrooms take you on a voyage of world cultures and global traditions. Witness designs that range from Byzantine and Classical to Renaissance and Romanesque. Step inside Beijing, Damascus, Athens and more to hear each room's unique story without having set foot outside Pittsburgh.

Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens

In 2020, Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens' complex of sustainable buildings was awarded a Governor’s Award for Environmental Excellence from the Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection.

Phipps’ sustainable efforts have reached a new level of excellence with the construction of three of the greenest buildings in the world on its campus: the Center for Sustainable Landscapes (CSL, opened in 2012) which is also the only building in the world to achieve five of the highest certifications for green construction (Living Building Challenge, LEED Platinum, WELL Platinum, SITES Platinum and BREEAM Outstanding in Use); the Nature Lab at Phipps (2015); and the Exhibit Staging Center (ESC, 2019). Pending the ESC’s successful completion of the Living Building Challenge’s year-long performance period, Phipps will have three Living Future Institute-certified buildings on a single site, each representing a unique use and construction type — new, modular and adaptive reuse — and demonstrating the potential of integrated, regenerative design.

David L. Lawrence Convention Center

The David L. Lawrence Convention Center is a significant symbol of the "new" Pittsburgh Region. As Pittsburgh continues to revolutionize into a regional destination place, this landmark building has become the cornerstone of the transformation. On the cutting edge of design, this innovative structure connects the urban city to the waterfront overlooking the Allegheny River.

The Convention Center boasts breath-taking views of the North Shore and Downtown Pittsburgh from the concourses, balconies and terraces, and is the only convention center in the world with LEED® (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) certifications of GOLD in new construction and PLATINUM in existing building, by the

U.S. Green Building Council

. As the first "green" convention center and world's largest "green" building, the Center capitalized on its environmentally smart structure by utilizing natural daylight and natural ventilation to light and heat the building, and incorporating a water reclamation system which reduces potable water use.

Stretching across the convention center's swooping roofline are 688 feet of blue light-emitting diode (LED) tubes. Jenny Holzer created this kinetic display titled For Pittsburgh to present important books that tell compelling stories about Pittsburgh, including Thomas Bell's Out of This Furnace; John Edgar Wideman's Homewood Trilogy, Damballah, Hiding Place, and Sent for You Yesterday; and Annie Dillard's An American Childhood. The texts scroll 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. For Pittsburgh is the artist's largest LED project in the United States.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Daniel G. and Carole L. Kamin Science Center's PPG Science Pavilion

The new expansion to the Science Center opened in June 2018 and is a 48,000-square-foot space that ushers in a new era of enhanced STEM programs, state-of-the-art exhibits, and public exploration of science and technology at the North Shore destination. The building is LEED Gold certified by the United States Green Building Council. This means the U.S. Green Building Council has recognized that PPG Science Pavilion is a healthy, highly efficient, and cost-saving green building. The building is coated with multiple PPG products, including PPG PAINTS™ SPEEDHIDE® interior paint, MEGASEAL™ epoxy by PPG, and more. Daniel G. and Carole L. Kamin Science Center's PPG Science Pavilion serves as an example of sustainable building practices.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PPG Paints Arena

The home of National Hockey League's Pittsburgh Penguins is the first LEED® Gold certified major sports venue in the country. The venue seats 18,087 people in honor of team captain Sidney Crosby's No. 87. The Center uses 40% less water consumption by volume and thanks in part to natural lighting and high-efficiency ventilation, boasts a 31% reduction in energy consumption.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Children's Museum of

Pittsburgh

The Children's Museum of Pittsburgh is an architectural masterpiece. In 2006, the Children's Museum received the Silver LEED® certification from the U.S. Green Building Council, making it the largest Silver LEED-certified museum in the country. The Museum also received the 2006

American Institute of Architects

Honor Award for Architecture. Design Architect Koning Eizenberg Architecture of Santa Monica, California and Executive Architect Perkins Eastman of Pittsburgh received this honor for excellence in architecture-considered the highest recognition of works in the field-for the Museum's 2004 expansion.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PNC Firstside Center

This five-story Silver LEED® certified building establishes PNC as a corporate leader in green building. An innovative hybrid system of air distribution improves energy efficiency, comfort and maintenance. The system includes a raised floor, that also makes the workspace flexible to reconfigure. The daylit interiors afford 90% of the occupants with an outdoor view. The urban infill site is adjacent to a bike trail and a light rail transit stop and has helped to revitalize the Downtown area.

Energy Innovation Center

This 200,000 square foot building is located in the Lower Hill District and houses a not-for-profit organization dedicated to supporting clean and sustainable energy. Built in 1930, the Energy Innovation Center (EIC) has LEED Platinum certification and is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as well as the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation's list of Historic Landmarks. Originally the Connelley Trade School, the building was redesigned according to the standards of sustainability and energy efficiency while maintaining its historic elements. It is now a home for workforce development programs, green technology research laboratories, and other community projects, such as the Penn State Center's creation of tree wells for stormwater management. Utilizing energy efficient techniques such as ice storage for cooling and an automatic zone control system which reduces energy consumption, the EIC is emerging as a leader in technological innovation.

Sports Venues & Stadiums

Part of Pittsburgh's architecture is exemplified by its sports venues including PPG Paints Arena, Acrisure Stadium and PNC Park.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Acrisure Stadium

Home of the

Pittsburgh Steelers

football team, the stadium was designed by HOK Sports Facilities Group and opened in 2001. The horseshoe-shaped two-tiered stadium offers more intimacy than many NFL venues, with natural grass, great sight lines and a wide-open view of the football action set against the beautiful backdrop of downtown Pittsburgh. There is no such thing as a bad seat in this football-oriented stadium which was obviously designed to take football from a game to an experience. Reflecting Pittsburgh''s steel legacy, steel is a primary building material in Acrisure Stadium. The majority of the steel is silvery grey in color, except for the large gold-painted ''quad pods'' which support the upper deck.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Large masonry anchors Acrisure Stadium, echoing the heavy stone bases of Pittsburgh''s downtown landmarks and bridges, such as the City-County Building and the Allegheny County Court House. Progressing up the stadium facade, the building gradually changes from steel and stone into walls of glass which reflect downtown skyscrapers such as PPG Place and Fifth Avenue Place, both of which are visible from inside the stadium. The 7,100 club seats tucked between the two levels on both sides of Acrisure Stadium offer a fantastic vantage point and access to the two three-story club lounges. These popular lounges feature a wall of glass from floor to ceiling for nearly the entire length of the building.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PPG Paints Arena

A multi-purpose indoor arena which is home to both the

National Hockey League's Pittsburgh Penguins

and the Area Football League's Pittsburgh Power. Construction was completed in 2010 and

PPG Paints Arena

is the first LEED® Gold certified major sports venue in the country. The venue seats 18,087 people in honor of Penguins team captain Sidney Crosby's No. 87. The Center uses 40% less water consumption by volume and thanks in part to natural lighting and high-efficiency ventilation, boasts a 31% reduction in energy consumption. As soon as the arena opened in 2010, it was lauded as one of the best in the world, winning both "Best New Major Concert Venue" in the Pollstar Concert Industry Awards and "Best NHL Arena" in the Sports Business Journal reader poll.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Populous, formerly HOK Sport, designers of PNC Park and Acrisure Stadium, designed the building working with local architect Astorino and Oxford Development oversaw the building of the arena. More than a dozen buildings were razed in order to create CONSOL Energy Center.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PNC Park

PNC Park, home to the

Pittsburgh Pirates baseball team

, opened in spring 2001. It is a classic-style ballpark, an intimate facility that embraces the progressiveness of Pittsburgh while saluting the spirit of early ballpark originals such as Forbes Field, Wrigley Field and Fenway Park. This riverfront facility combines the best features of yesterday's ballparks-rhythmic archways, steel trusswork and a natural grass playing field-with the latest in fan and player amenities and comfort. Its prime location along the shore of the Allegheny River and adjacent to Federal Street takes advantage of scenic vistas of the Downtown skyline and riverfront, as well as pedestrian and riverboat access, creating an exciting and dramatic urban sports venue. PNC Park is approachable and pedestrian in scale. Designed to fit within the existing city grid, it is also oriented to allow a great majority of spectators a spectacular view of the Clemente Bridge and the downtown skyline beyond.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The facility was designed by Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum (HOK), Inc. of Kansas City, Missouri. The design and construction management team consisted of a joint venture between Pittsburgh-based Dick Corporation and Barton Malow with offices in Baltimore, MD. The Architect of Record was L.D. Astorino & Associates of Pittsburgh. PNC Park is the first ballpark with a two-deck design to be built in the United States since Milwaukee's County Stadium was completed in 1953. Because of its intimate design, the highest seat is just 88 feet from the field, giving every fan in the park an ideal sight line. PNC Park is named as America's Best Ballpark by TripAdvisor and ESPN.com and among the "Top Ten Best Ballparks in the nation" by FOX Sports.

Theaters

The performing arts play an important part in the culture of Pittsburgh. There are multiple theaters and so much history to be seen at each one.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Benedum Center for the Performing Arts

Pittsburgh''s 2,885 seat Benedum Center is the result of a $42 million restoration and expansion of the Stanley Theatre, built in 1928 as "a movie palace version of Versailles." This one-time vaudeville hall has been renovated with grand style. Every detail-from the 500,000-piece crystal chandelier to the gilded plasterwork-has been restored or replicated and after its two-year renovation, it looks as it did on opening night in 1928.

The signature piece of the Benedum Center, the original main chandelier, weighs 4,700 pounds and measures 20 feet high and 12 feet wide. The Grand Lobby mirrors, marble and woodwork are all original, and at the landing on each staircase in the Grand Lobby are 18-foot high original mirrors meant to be reminiscent of the Hall of Mirrors at the Palace of Versailles.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Byham Theater

Originally built in 1903 as the Gayety Theater, the Byham Theater opened on

Halloween

night, 1904. It ran for many years as one of the country''s foremost stage and vaudeville houses, with appearances from such stars as Ethel Barrymore, Gertrude Lawrence and Helen Hayes. In the 1930s, the theater was renamed The Fulton and became a full-time movie theater. The Pittsburgh Cultural Trust purchased the theater in 1990 and following the first of four planned phases of renovation, the Fulton was reopened in May 1991. It was later renamed the Byham Theater through a naming gift from the Byham family following the second phase of renovation in 1995.

The Gayety boasted pressed copper cherubs painted with a bronze patina, imitation gold leaf, stained glass windows, plaster columns and wainscot of scagolia, an Italian faux marble technique. In the entry vestibule, note the original mosaic tile floor and the many bare light bulbs lining the ceiling, evidence of the advent of electrical lighting. The old lighted Fulton marquee was restored by the State Museum of Pennsylvania in Harrisburg. The second phase of renovations brought new restrooms, box office, marquee, an elevator, lobby improvements and facade changes. In 1997, the Cherub Lobby was restored to its original splendor.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Heinz Hall

This restored 1926 movie theater's architecture now serves as the backdrop for much of Pittsburgh's cultural activity. It's the crown jewel of venues in Pittsburgh's Cultural District and has an international reputation for grandeur and excellence as a concert hall and showplace. The 2,661-seat world-class venue is home to the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, which performs 30 concerts in the Hall annually.

Despite several renovations over the years, much of the basic architecture of the building has remained unchanged from its original French Court style. In the Hall's beautiful lobby, ornate Italian marble shines and baroque relief, shimmering crystal lights and exquisite chandeliers provide the allure for an evening of stage and show. Breche opal and Lavanto marble, plush red velvet and shimmering crystal are the main elements in the decoration of the interior of the Hall and 24-karat gold leaf detailing is seen throughout.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

O'Reilly Theater

The O'Reilly is the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust's only newly constructed theater. It was created with two purposes: to create a Downtown home for the Pittsburgh Public Theater and add an additional venue for

theater, music and other performances

. Designed by world-renowned architect Michael Graves, the O'Reilly Theater is the only downtown performance venue that features a thrust stage, surrounded by the audience on three sides. Its aesthetic is signature Graves-smooth, polished, pared-down and classic. The theater's wood is all curly maple, with the sensuous grain producing the primary decorative effect. Built at a cost of $25 million, the 650-seat capacity, state-of-the-art theater officially opened in December of 1999.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Downtown

Church of the Epiphany

The Church of the Epiphany, a Roman Catholic church designed in 1902 by architect Edward Stotz, was designed in the form of an Italian Romanesque basilica, and built of redbrick with terra cotta trim. The interior decoration, which includes frescoes, was designed by John Comes, a principal designer of Catholic churches in the Pittsburgh area at the time. The church is the center of a complex of four buildings, including a parish house (1902), a school (1910), and the St. Regis Residence (1914).

First Lutheran Church

Designed by architect Andrew Peebles in 1887-88 and begun while the Allegheny County Courthouse was being completed, the Romanesque style First Lutheran Church reflects the design of the Courthouse with its rusticated stonework and vermilion-tinted mortar. The exterior is dominated by tall gabled roofs and a spire that rises 170 feet. The plan of the church is in the form of a Greek cross, which gives it a centralized character. The white plaster walls are broken with three tall windows; the window in the north transept ("The Good Shepherd") was designed by Frederick Wilson and fabricated by the Tiffany Studios in 1898. The altar, which was installed after 1892, was designed in the Italian Renaissance style, with mosaics.

First Presbyterian Church

Designed in 1903-1905 by architect Theophilus P. Chandler, the First Presbyterian Church stands on land that was donated to the church in 1787 by the Penn family for religious purposes. The church structure was designed by a Philadelphia architect who ended up designing three Presbyterian churches in Pittsburgh. The exterior design is in the English Gothic style, and its twin-towered facade is reminiscent of Gothic cathedral design. The interior was laid out as a single large rectangular space, with the pulpit at one end and galleries raised along the sides. In this way, the architecture emphasizes the preaching function of the service. There are no full-height piers in the space because the roof is carried on two massive arched wooden trusses that span the length of the church, above the fronts of the galleries. These structurally-daring trusses are encased in elaborately carved woodwork. The ceiling between the arches is borne on hammer truss beams. The curved paneled wall behind the stone pulpit opens to reveal a rear wing that is lined with three levels of Sunday-school classrooms. The rough stone walls on the interior are opened up by significant stained-glass windows. All of the nave windows, except one, were designed and produced by the Tiffany Studios in New York. The large east window, in the Sunday-school wing, is the work of Clayton & Bell, of London, and depicts a "Jesse Tree", or genealogy of Christ. The "west" window, in the facade of the church, was designed and built by William Willett of Boston.

Smithfield United Church

This Gothic-style building was designed and built in 1925-26 by one of Pittsburgh's premiere Classical architects, Henry Hornbostel. The mass of the building culminates in a square tower that is capped by an openwork aluminum spire, an early architectural use of aluminum. The Gothic ornament on the exterior is a surface treatment, limited to the exterior stone panels attached to the steel structural frame. The tall, relatively narrow sanctuary at the top of the building is focused on the 18-foot-diameter rose window. The side walls are lined with tall stained-glass windows that depict both the life and teachings of Christ, and the history of this congregation and of the city of Pittsburgh. The interior ornament, like the exterior, is surface ornament dominated by Gothic arches, with plaster fan and groin vaults in the ceiling.

St. Mary of Mercy Roman Catholic Church

St. Mary's is the newest and smallest of the churches in Downtown Pittsburgh. The church was designed by architect William P. Hutchins in 1936, and stands out by contrast with its neighbors, in its size and its red brick exterior, with Gothic details in stone. St. Mary's has been built out at the sidewalk line, with its entrance located under a simple square tower at its corner. The principal aisle inside the church follows the diagonal axis of the entry toward the altar. The interior is relatively plain and auditorium-like: a modern church interior built before the Second Vatican Council.

Trinity Cathedral

Designed by architect Gordon Lloyd in1870-71, the church's parish house was designed in 1907 by Crocker & Carpenter. The exterior was designed in the Early Decorated English Gothic Style that was favored by mid-Victorian Episcopalians, with a single central steeple and side transepts. The interior features a tall nave flanked by aisles and lit by clerestory windows. The plaster nave walls are supported by clustered stone columns, and the austere interior ornamentation, in which the pointed arch predominates, is reminiscent of the work of the American Gothicist Richard Upjohn. Some of the stained glass windows in the nave were destroyed in a fire in 1967, and were replaced by new ones in a medieval style. The rest of the windows date from 1872. The carved stone pulpit was built in 1922 to the design of the renowned American architect Bertram G. Goodhue.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

North Shore

Calvary United Methodist Church

An historic landmark in one of Pittsburgh's most charming neighborhoods, the Calvary Church is a stunning example of European-inspired architecture and features three magnificently restored, 30-foot Louis Comfort Tiffany stained glass windows. Other features include delicate spires and friendly gargoyles, an elegant wooden ceiling, stunning decoration, and historic Farrand & Votey pipe organ.

Emmanuel Episcopal Church

Completed in 1886, Emmanuel Episcopal Church, also on the North Side, is a classic example of the work of Boston architect Henry Hobson Richardson and is on the National Register of Historic Places. It is built on property acquired in 1882 from Macher Warfield -- a cousin of Wallis Warfield, later the Duchess of Windsor. The church's decor includes a "reredos" an impressive ornamental screen behind the altar featuring stained glass angels, mosaics and marble statues.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Oakland

Heinz Memorial Chapel

It is a place where people find serenity and discover the joy of celebration. Crafted of limestone and solid oak, this Neo-Gothic masterwork instantly captivates in a panorama of vaulted ceilings, soaring arches, and more than 250,000 individual pieces of exquisite stained glass. For over a century, Heinz Memorial Chapel has been the Pittsburgh destination for dream weddings, special concerts, guided tours and quiet reflection.

Saint Paul's Cathedral

Saint Paul's Cathedral was opened in 1906 at its present site on Fifth Avenue in the Oakland section of Pittsburgh. Designed by Egan and Prindeville of Chicago and built by Thomas Reilly, a general contractor from Philadelphia, Saint Paul's is an example of the Scholastic, or Decorated, Gothic style of the 14th Century. The building rises 247 feet with a statue of Saint Paul mounted on the center pediment. Other exterior statues depict the apostles and evangelists of the Eastern and Western Church. While the overall proportions of the structure are not true to the classic cathedrals of Europe, Saint Paul Cathedral fits the site and (as the cathedrals of old) reflects their spirit and historical significance.

St. Benedict the Moor

St. Benedict the Moor

As the first Roman Catholic church in the Pittsburgh area for Black Catholics, St. Benedict the Moor, which sits across the street from Freedom Corner in the Hill District, was successfully organized more than 130 years ago on the third attempt to form a parish for Black parishioners, according to Greta Stokes Tucker, a longtime member of St. Benedict the Moor.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

She said the first attempt was prior to the Civil War. It was on Heldman Street, in the Hill District, on July 28, 1889, that the Diocese of Pittsburgh established St. Benedict the Moor under the leadership of Patrick McDermott, C.S.Sp., a member of the Holy Ghost Fathers at Duquesne University. It was after Fr. McDermott’s meeting with local Black Catholics and his attending the Black Catholic Lay Congress, in Washington, D.C., in January of 1889, that the cries of local Black Catholics were heard.

In its earlier years, St. Benedict merged with several other parishes — Saint Brigid, Holy Trinity and Saint Richard Churches — and in 1962, after the demolition of St. Brigid, the parish relocated to the former Holy Trinity building, which sits on the corner of Crawford Street and Centre Avenue, and is where St. Benedict the Moor serves the community today.

It was in 1968 that Bishop John J. Wright dedicated the sacred landmark of the 18-foot-tall statue of the Saint Benedict the Moor, a Black saint, which sits on the very top of the church and can be seen from miles away. Also, a couple years later, according to the church’s website , Fr. Augustus Taylor, Jr., was installed as the first Black pastor in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pittsburgh and was assigned to what was then being called Saint Brigid-Saint Benedict the Moor Church. Years later, after another re-consolidation, the church was re-established as St. Benedict the Moor.

In an effort to continue meeting the needs of the community, especially its educational needs, through the church, in 1973, Hill District Catholic School was formed and later renamed to what is now known as St. Benedict the Moor School, located on Watt Street.

More recently, in July of 2020, Bishop David Zubik established St. Benedict as a personal parish for the Black Catholic community in the Diocese of Pittsburgh. While all are welcome, a personal parish is one that responds to specific spiritual needs often related to a particular culture or an extraordinary need, in this case the Black community. Tucker said, through its history, St. Benedict the Moor has a connection throughout the Hill, in one form or another, and hopes that with its new honor, it will remain a “beacon” in the Hill, as well as throughout the six counties that comprise the Diocese.

“The church is very dear to me; I’ve grown up seeing what the church does in the community. In Pittsburgh, specifically, some of the churches we work with are the backbone of the community,” said Genevieve Oduor, a PHLF board member and chair of the Historic Religious Properties Grant Program committee. “Churches have stood in the gap for the committee…I can’t imagine where we would be without the Black church.”

Frank Lloyd Wright

The Laurel Highlands, just 60 minutes from Pittsburgh, is home to four Frank Lloyd Wright masterpieces, all of which are open to the public.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fallingwater

Called "The best all-time work of American architecture" by the American Institute of Architects, and named one of "50 Places of a Lifetime" by National Geographic, Fallingwater is located 90 minutes south of Pittsburgh in the idyllic Laurel Highlands. The house is dramatically cantilevered over a waterfall and widely considered to be Wright's most sublime integration of man and nature. Fallingwater is open daily, except for Wednesday, mid-March through November. In-depth, self-guided grounds and children's tours available. Advanced ticket purchase or reservations are essential.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Duncan House

Wright-designed Duncan House at Polymath Park Resort is nestled deep in the heart of the Laurel Highlands in Acme, Pa., about 90 minutes from Pittsburgh. It is one of only four Frank Lloyd Wright homes in the U.S. that offers overnight lodging. The house's floor plan includes Wright's trademark open living/dining area with a natural stone fireplace as its focal point. Recessed lighting, built-in cabinetry and geometric styling are obvious throughout the home. Natural colors and fabrics are used to reflect Wright's dedication to the preservation of nature and its integration with indoor spaces. Polymath Park Resort is situated on more than 100 tranquil and scenic wooded acres including miles of hiking trails and a peaceful reflecting pond. The Duncan House Polymath Park Resort is just 15 miles from Fallingwater and 30 miles from Kentuck Knob. The resort also includes the Balter and Blum Houses, built for Pittsburgh industrialists by Wright apprentice Peter Berndtson.

Kentuck Knob

Two-thousand glorious feet above the Youghiogheny River sits yet another Frank Lloyd Wright masterwork. Settled in the crest of the hill-this culmination of organic architecture and elegant living space makes the home appear as if it were one with the mountain. Tidewater red cypress and native fieldstone are its core elements. A completely functional kitchen is central to the foundations architectural design, while stonewalls anchor this privately owned residence. The rest of the open floor plan utilizes cantilevered overhangs and a great expanse of glass that make you feel as though you're one with nature. A large outdoor sculpture garden is also present on the grounds.

Mäntylä House

The newest addition to the Frank Lloyd Wright collection in the Laurel Highlands is the Mäntylä House in Polymouth Park. Mäntylä, meaning "of the pines," was designed by Wright in 1952 and features dramatic angles and, of course, an homage to nature. Visitors are welcomed to experience a guided

tour

of the house during the day, or plan a trip to stay overnight, March through December. Specialized tours include the opportunity to dine inside the home at a Wright-designed table or to enjoy breakfast and a tour in the morning hours when the house's unique structure shines bright.

Covered Bridges

Covered Bridges

Learn about the history and the why of covered bridges and where you can see them in the Pittsburgh area!

The first covered bridge in the United States was built in Philadelphia in 1805—it was named the Permanent Bridge. Over the course of the next century roughly 12,000 of these iconic American spans were constructed across the country, and while the Permanent Bridge is gone, 750 remain standing today, 47 of them in southwestern Pennsylvania.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Why Cover a Wooden Bridge?

In the early 1800s, agriculture and industrialization were growing rapidly throughout the Northeast and the coastal rivers and estuaries were lifelines of trade and communication. But as the coastal population penetrated inland, the many rivers and creeks cutting across the region became barriers to overland transport. Farmers and industrialists alike needed bridges to enable commerce across an increasingly sprawling and disconnected region.

Traditional European building methods wouldn't work in the comparatively harsh North American climate—hot

summers

and frigid winters created freeze/thaw cycles that would overturn stone pavings—but the dry air meant that wood wouldn't rot, and so it became the building material of choice. The reason to cover these bridges was simple: less exposure to the elements meant the wooden superstructures would last longer.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Truss Types

Covered bridges are differentiated by the types of trusses used to support the roadway. These trusses were often named after their creators, and met with varying degrees of success. One early design, the multiple kingpost truss, consisted of a series of triangular sections supported by a central vertical ''kingpost'', and could span up to 100 feet. The Burr arch truss, named for its inventor Theodore Burr, was one of the more popular, featuring two large wooden arches connected to a kingpost truss framework. There are 123 bridges remaining in Pennsylvania using the Burr truss design —more than all other truss designs combined. Nathaniel Town created the Town truss, a latticework of smaller timbers that could be constructed by unskilled laborers and span distances of up to 200 feet. The Theodore Burr Covered Bridge Society has a

comprehensive online resource

of truss types.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Mythology + Trivia

The greatest period of covered bridge building took place between 1820 and 1900.

Pennsylvania has 210 remaining covered bridges—more than any other state.

The red color of many covered bridges in southwestern PA is from an early paint formula: oxides found in the local soil possessed natural insecticidal properties. The traditional red color is still popular, even though the paint formula is modern.

They were commonly nicknamed "kissing bridges", derived from the exploits of young suitors trying to steal kisses from their sweethearts while passing through the bridges' darkened interiors.

Several old wives'' tales exist to explain why these bridges were covered. The most popular include scaring off evil spirits, or making it easier to herd cattle across the water by imitating the shape of a barn.
