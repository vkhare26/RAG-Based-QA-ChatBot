Historical Sites to Visit

It’s no secret that Pittsburgh has been an influential city for centuries, and the evidence can be found all around the city!

Having played meaningful roles in moments and eras throughout history – the French and Indian War, the Civil Rights Movement and the Industrial Revolution - it’s only fitting that many of these involvements are memorialized throughout the city.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fort Pitt Block House

Pittsburgh’s oldest architectural landmark, the Fort Pitt Block House is all that remains of Fort Pitt, one of the largest and most elaborate British forts and a key defense in the French and Indian War. Built in 1764, the Block House was gifted to the Fort Pitt Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution in 1894 and has remained free and open to the visitors for more than a century.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Freedom Corner

Located in Pittsburgh’s Hill District neighborhood at the intersection of Centre Avenue and Crawford Street, the Freedom Corner monument marks a crucial point in Pittsburgh’s extensive Civil Rights history and serves as an important gathering location for those advocating for peace, justice and equality.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Tribute to Children Statue

Locally known as the Mister Rogers Memorial, the memorial was built in 2009 to commemorate Pittsburgh’s friendliest neighbor and television icon, Fred Rogers. The bronze sculpture is accompanied by a sound system so that visitors can listen to 29 musical compositions by Fred Rogers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

August Wilson House

The building, located at 1727 Bedford Ave., in Pittsburgh’s Hill District, is at the heart of American literary history. The childhood home of award-winning playwright August Wilson, the August Wilson House is dedicated to celebrating his literary and personal legacy while also serving as an arts center to the Hill District community.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Homewood Cemetery

Founded in 1878, the Homewood Cemetery is bordered by Frick Park and the Point Breeze neighborhood. It features exquisite architecture and art alongside more than 600 mature trees. A long list of notable Pittsburghers buried on-site include Henry J. Heinz, Henry Clay Frick, Charles “Teenie” Harris, Mac Miller, Chuck Cooper and many more.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Carrie Blast Furnace

Experience pre-World War II iron-making technology at the iconic and historic Carrie Blast Furnaces. Led by Rivers of Steel, tours take visitors through the non-operative blast furnaces while detailing the historical impact that the furnaces, along with the industry, had on local residents, businesses and the world.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Andy Warhol’s Grave

Andy Warhol is buried at St. John the Baptist Byzantine Catholic Cemetery in Pittsburgh-suburb Bethel Park alongside his parents, Julie and Andrej Wahola. The gravesite is often found adorned with Campbell’s soup cans to commemorate the Pittsburgh-born artist.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Southwestern Pennsylvania World War II Memorial

Located along Pittsburgh’s North Shore, this awe-inspiring memorial commemorates the efforts of veterans from the region who served overseas and at home during World War II. Explore the images that tell the stories through the eyes of the veterans, their families and the people of Southwestern PA.

Learning Washington County History "Pandemic" Style

In this history-making year, the Washington County Historical Society is helping students connect with our region’s storied past.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Article by

Kathleen Hondru

Hundreds of years from now, students across the globe will discover how a global pandemic changed the way people lived, worked, and learned.

Recognizing the unprecedented challenges that students, educators – and parents – are facing with remote learning, the Washington County Historical Society and the Washington County Tourism Promotion Agency saw an opportunity to assist.

“Part of our mission is to promote awareness of Washington County’s remarkable history,” shared Clay Kilgore, executive director of the Washington County Historical Society. “And while we are not able to do that right now through in-person educational programming at schools or field trips to our historic sites, now more than ever, we understand the need to provide educational support to our region’s educators. So we came up with a new way to do it.”

For Kilgore, it is the stories of the past that bring history to life. With the help of the Washington County Tourism Promotion Agency, Kilgore is sharing the region’s stories in a new educational web series, “Laid Back History: Student Edition.”

“While the dates in history are important, in my experience, it is the stories that students remember, and it is the stories that spark their interest and curiosity. Our new web series aims to teach our region’s history through storytelling."

“We chose topics that are covered in our state’s grade school and high school American History and Social Studies curriculum and believe we have made the information accessible for students of all ages, while still informative.”

Initially launched in 2020, the web series currently consists of five episodes, with four more in production. The episodes range in length, from 12 to 22 minutes, and feature Kilgore sitting on the couch in his living room, telling stories about the region’s past.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

“The response has been very positive,” he shared. “Because of the strong response to the initial episodes, and requests for additional topics, we decided to film four more."

“And while the episodes were created with students in mind, we are pleased that others in our region, and beyond, are watching and learning about Washington County’s history and our historical sites – sites that we look forward to welcoming visitors back to in the not-so-distant future.”

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Topics covered in the initial web episodes include the Whiskey Rebellion, the National Road, Native Americans of Western Pennsylvania and our region’s involvement, and passageway along the Underground Railroad.

“One of the topics that we cover in an upcoming episode, something I think many will be surprised to learn, is that one of the last battles of the American Revolution actually took place at Rice’s Fort, outside of Claysville. Many people do not realize that one of the final battles of the Revolutionary War took place right here in Washington County.”

Today the land where Rice’s Fort once stood is now farmland, but a historical marker at the location commemorates how the Battle at Rice’s Fort and the battle at Fort Henry, located in Wheeling, West Virginia, took place as the Revolutionary War came to a close.

The web episode about Rice’s Fort also addresses a popular myth, told for generations in Washington County about how the defenders of the fort melted pewter to make ammunition when they ran out of traditional lead musket balls. In the Laid Back History web episode about this historic battlefield, Kilgore shares information that was literally uncovered while making a show about the fort for National Geographic Channel’s TV Show “Diggers.” That TV show was filmed in 2015 at the site where Rice’s Fort once stood.

As the executive director of Washington County’s Historical Society, Kilgore is passionate about sharing and promoting Washington County’s treasured history.

“To understand who we are today, we really need to understand who we were two hundred years ago,” shared Kilgore. “Understanding how we dealt with things in the past, and why, provides some clues to understanding our region’s character traits today.”

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Kilgore explained that two hundred years ago, the power and decision-making for the state were located east, in Philadelphia and Harrisburg. People living in southwestern Pennsylvania believed they needed to counter that power imbalance by standing up for themselves and defending their rights, as witnessed by the events of the Whiskey Rebellion. They were fiercely loyal to, and protective of, their homes and livelihoods, traits that Kilgore sees today in how citizens of this region are fiercely proud of their hometowns, traditions, and their

sports teams

.

“While we navigate the unprecedented challenges before us, as a society we are all coming up with new and different ways of doing things, much like how our region’s ancestors did while they were forging a new life for themselves on what was then called the ‘Western Frontier’ and is now known as Washington County.”

“The ‘Laid Back History’ web series is one of the ways we are doing things differently to support our mission and helping students connect with Washington County’s remarkable history – and hopefully in the process, helping them gain a new perspective of how the lessons of history can help us better understand and navigate the challenges we face today,” said Kilgore.

In announcing the series, Jeff Kotula, President of the Washington County Chamber of Commerce & Tourism Promotion Agency, stated, “The WCHS and we partnered on this series to not only build upon the successful Laid Back History web series, but also to provide our teachers, parents and students with ways to supplement their curriculum during the COVID-19 emergency. We understand that many parents are working with their children at home and wanted to provide additional educational opportunities for them.” Kotula noted that the agency and society received input from local school superintendents to ensure the series would be effective and valuable to teachers, parents, and students.

The Essential Gardens to Visit in Pittsburgh

If you’ve got french fries on your deli sandwich and the folks around you can correctly pronounce Monongahela, you’re probably in Pittsburgh.

“The Burgh” loves its blue-collar roots. You’ll find plenty of hearty eating and neighborhood charm to go around. But in a city best known for sports, and now technology, visitors are sometimes surprised to find so many beautiful gardens to explore! If you want a stroll through manicured beds and Pennsylvania wildflowers, you’re in the right place. Here are our top picks for the essential gardens to visit in Pittsburgh.

Pittsburgh Botanic Garden

The 60-acre

Pittsburgh Botanic Garden

opened to the public in 2015. It is home to thousands of plants, including many native shrubs and trees. The park sits on land that was once damaged by poor mining and forestry practices. Today, it's a beautiful testament to how an environment can be improved with the right kind of effort. The grounds include a pond surrounded by cherry trees. There’s also a restored log house and a rotating garden featuring seasonal plants and flowers.

Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens

No list of Pittsburgh gardens would be complete without

Phipps Conservatory

and Botanical Gardens. Built in 1893 by Henry W. Phipps, it offers year-round exhibits and flower shows. The outdoor grounds and the Victorian glasshouse both provide unique displays. Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Gardens is also home to one of the greenest buildings on Earth, the Center for Sustainable Landscapes. Phipps is a teaching conservatory, hosting a variety of tours and offering hundreds of classes.

Entry Garden at Highland Park

Unlike many of our picks for essential gardens, the

Highland Park Entry Garden

is not on the Pittsburgh Garden Trail. Between the late 19th century and the early 2000s, this garden fell to disrepair. Thanks to the efforts of the Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy, it is now a community favorite. While you’re in Highland Park, make sure to check out the

Pittsburgh Zoo and PPG Aquarium

Historic Carrie Blast Furnaces

The

Carrie Blast Furnaces National Historic Landmark

is the quintessential Pittsburgh garden. You'll find it inside the Rivers of Steel National Heritage Area. The landmark combines pre-World War II blast furnaces with a gorgeous garden walk. A guided tour among the abandoned furnaces highlights the native plants returning to the site. Metal sculptures in the park emphasize the difference between industry and nature. The Carrie Blast Furnaces sits a bit outside the city, but the history and stunning Pennsylvania wildflowers make this one well worth the trip.

Rodef Shalom Biblical Botanical Garden

The

Rodef Shalom Biblical Botanical Garden

is Pittsburgh’s answer to the holy lands. Rodef Shalom was built to mimic some of the Middle East’s most iconic sights. It sports a mountainous northern region and a desert region, and also a “Jordan River.” Some of the garden’s plant species were chosen for their biblical monikers. You'll see plants including Joseph’s coat and Solomon’s seal. Its convenient location in the Oakland neighborhood and free admission make it an easy, carefree place to take a breather.

The Frick Pittsburgh

Created by Helen Clay Frick (daughter of 19th-century industrialist Henry Clay Frick),

This garden

is the pride of Pittsburgh’s East End. Boasting six full acres, there’s no shortage of things to explore. Sights include lawns and gardens, an art museum, and a restored 23-room mansion, Clayton. Admission for the grounds, the car and carriage museum, art museum, and gardens is free, but there is a fee for touring the historic Frick house.
