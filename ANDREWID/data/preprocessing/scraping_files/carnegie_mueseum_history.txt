description: Gertrude Abercrombie (American, 1909–1977) was a critical figure in the mid-20th-century Chicago art scene and a creative force who, from the 1930s until her death in 1977, produced enigmatic paintings populated with objects and figures of personal significance. With a deft hand, a concise symbolic vocabulary, and a restrained palette, she created potent images that speak to her mercurial nature and her evolving psychology as an artist. Cats, owls, snails, doors, moons, barren trees, seashells, forking paths, and masked figures all converge in her mysterious works, which suggest a life of wistful introspection and emotional struggle. Drawing consistently on her own dreams as source material, Abercrombie said, “The whole world is a mystery.”

This exhibition presents a rare opportunity for museum visitors to appreciate—in significant depth—Abercrombie’s highly personal language that draws on surrealist and magic realism approaches to probe deeply into the nature of things. Featuring loans from important institutional and private collections, Gertrude Abercrombie: The Whole World Is a Mystery is the most comprehensive museum presentation of the artist’s work to date.

Gertrude Abercrombie: The Whole World Is a Mystery is co-organized by Carnegie Museum of Art and Colby College Museum of Art, and is curated by Eric Crosby, Henry J. Heinz II Director, Carnegie Museum of Art, and Vice President, Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, and Sarah Humphreville, Lunder Curator of American Art, Colby College Museum of Art, with Cynthia Stucki, curatorial assistant, Carnegie Museum of Art. The exhibition will be on view at Colby College Museum of Art from July 12, 2025 through Jan. 11, 2026.

Gertrude Abercrombie was born in 1909 in Austin, Texas. She grew up in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago but also spent significant time in her father’s hometown of Aledo, Illinois, which would later become a source of inspiration for her paintings. She earned a degree in Romance languages at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, in 1929, after which she pursued a year-long course in commercial art at the American Academy of Art and may also have briefly attended the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.

In 1932, Abercrombie began her career as a professional artist, an ambition that was forwarded when she gained employment on the Federal Art Project of the Works Progress Administration (WPA/FAP) from 1935–1940. She showed her work widely, including in the Art Institute of Chicago’s annual exhibitions and at avant-garde venues like the Katharine Kuh Gallery. By the late 1930s, Abercrombie had developed her mature style, creating tightly executed paintings populated by personal symbols that pulse with mystery and which have been identified with surrealism, magic realism, and the fantastic. She worked in this vein for the remainder of her career, but her output gradually decreased toward the end of her life due to ongoing health struggles. Abercrombie was also well known as the host of parties and jam sessions, which were attended by her artist, writer, and jazz musician friends.

Every reasonable effort has been made to identify, contact, and acknowledge rights holders. To correct an error or omission, please reach out to our Rights and Reproductions team.

Gertrude Abercrombie was a fervent listener of jazz and organized regular jam sessions at her home in Hyde Park, Chicago. This playlist combines the jazz she loved and songs with themes that are found in her work and life.

This book is the definitive scholarly volume on artist Gertrude Abercrombie, who was a critical figure in the mid-20th-century Chicago art and jazz scenes.

Join artist educators for Dandy Andy, a monthly tour that focuses on Warhol’s queer history. While his sexuality is frequently suppressed or debated, Warhol was a gay man who had several partners throughout his life. Warhol’s boyfriends, including Edward Wallowitch, John Giorno, and Jed Johnson, were also his colleagues and collaborators, helping to shape and define his career as an artist. This tour traces Warhol’s romantic relationships and queer identity against the backdrop of the historical gay rights movement in the United States. Tours meet on the museum’s seventh floor.

description: Where do we find rest? How do we share our meals? Can the spaces we inhabit daily help us better nurture one another? How might the design of a living room or a kitchen relate to—and empower—a broader sense of community?

For Tatiana Bilbao (born 1972) and her Mexico City practice Tatiana Bilbao Estudio, architecture results from research that includes exploratory exhibitions. In this exhibition, five of the galleries are assigned an individual room typology—kitchen, bedroom, bathroom, living room, and garden. The architects associate each room type with current projects, revealing, for instance, the role of communal kitchens in a residential building in Mexico City or the way small gardens coexist with houses in St. Louis, MO. These relationships offer new possibilities for privacy and publicness.

City of Rooms communicates an approach to architecture filled with incident and capable of change across time. Tatiana Bilbao Estudio’s vision, research, and experimental practice welcome us into an interdependent, vital, and mutually supportive urban fabric, a proverbial city of rooms.

Tatiana Bilbao Estudio: City of Rooms is organized by Raymund Ryan, curator-at-large, Heinz Architectural Center.

The programs of the Heinz Architectural Center are made possible by the generosity of the Drue Heinz Trust.

Generous support for the exhibition is provided by the Graham Foundation for Advanced Studies in the Fine Arts.

Carnegie Museum of Art’s exhibition program is supported by the Carnegie Museum of Art Exhibition Fund and The Fellows of Carnegie Museum of Art.

Carnegie Museum of Art is supported by The Heinz Endowments and Allegheny Regional Asset District. Carnegie Museum of Art receives state arts funding support through a grant from the Pennsylvania Council on the Arts, a state agency funded by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania.

description: Systems of categorization and inevitable mislabeling, material preservation and eventual degradation, and an impulse to record in the face of inherent forgetfulness—these contradictions inform Gala Porras-Kim’s (b. 1984, Bogotá, Colombia) interest in museums and their practices. In dialogue with curators at Carnegie Museum of Art over the past two years, Porras-Kim has been trawling the museum’s database to better understand its holdings and the Carnegie Institute’s evolving cataloguing systems and acquisition history. Her findings reveal overlapping areas in the collections of Carnegie Museum of Art, Carnegie Museum of Natural History, and Carnegie Public Library, where each institution stewards their objects differently—as art, science, and information respectively. Porras-Kim proposes that art is not a fixed category, and questions the conceptual frameworks and individual subjectivities that go into presenting and understanding an object as a work of art.

Gala Porras-Kim is organized by Liz Park, Richard Armstrong Curator of Contemporary Art, and Cynthia Stucki, curatorial assistant.

Forum Gallery presents the work of living artists in an ongoing series that invites them to expand their practice through a commission or new presentation of existing works. Initiated in 1990, and with 86 projects to date, the Forum series is an opportunity for artists to deepen their relationship to and understanding of the museum.

Major support for Carnegie Museum of Art’s Forum series is provided by the Juliet Lea Hillman Simonds Foundation.

Abstract

The potential for long-term bird banding datasets to contribute to scientific literature is immense, and researchers are using these datasets to
study trends over time (e.g., populations, phenology, behavior, migration, distributions, morphology). Many studies rely on data collected at a single location or over a short period, and while it is valuable to analyze a single large dataset, the conclusions may not be broadly applicable to different geographic and temporal ranges, or to different species or even different populations of the focal species. Comparing multiple long-term datasets comprised of many species from multiple locations is proving to be valuable in identifying and describing patterns in space and time, and among populations and species. Several multi-station analyses have been published that show trends and patterns single-datasets may overlook.

Powdermill Avian Research Center has operated the longest continuously-run, year-round bird banding program in the country, gathering over 830,000 banding records and facilitating countless avian research projects since its inception in 1961. Similarly, Black Swamp Bird Observatory in northwest Ohio has been operating a banding station during the spring and fall migration periods since 1992, amassing over 350,000 records. In this presentation, she compares long-term trends in refueling rate and arrival condition, and changes in wing morphology at both stations, and discusses the importance of collaborations among bird banding operations in strengthening analyses to recognize patterns spatially and temporally.

description: Raymond Saunders: Flowers from a Black Garden is the artist’s first survey exhibition at a major American museum and the most in-depth consideration of his practice to date.

Since the 1960s, artist Raymond Saunders (b. 1934) has developed a painting practice rooted in improvisation. Working across mediums, he combines everyday objects, found imagery, drawing, notational markings, and text in constellated compositions that blend abstraction and figuration against the complex backdrop of American history.

Saunders was born and raised in Pittsburgh, PA, where he participated in Carnegie Museum of Art’s still ongoing Saturday art classes for young people. His mentor, Joseph C. Fitzpatrick, the instructor of the museums’ Saturday art classes and the director of art for Pittsburgh public schools, also taught Andy Warhol, Philip Pearlstein, and Mel Bochner. He obtained a scholarship to the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and went on to earn a BFA from Carnegie Institute of Technology (1960). He then moved to Oakland, CA, where he continues to live and work. He received an MFA from the California College of Arts and Crafts (1961) and later served there and at California State University East Bay as a faculty member.

In his large-scale works, Saunders routinely deploys a black ground recalling a literal blackboard and the ideas explored in his 1967 essay Black Is a Color, in which he claims an expansive role for the Black artist. “i am not here to play the gallery,” Saunders writes. “i am not responsible for anyone’s entertainment. i am responsible for being as fully myself, as man and artist, as I possibly can be, while allowing myself to hope that in the effort some light, some love, some beauty may be shed upon the world, and perhaps some inequities put right.”

This exhibition moves freely across the artist’s career, taking as its point of departure Saunders’s position as a consummate student and passionate teacher of painting. Through some 35 works, including important institutional loans, it will investigate his multifaceted and nonlinear process of picture-making, which carries forward, in reference and reverence, myriad histories and languages of art. From Dada, expressionism, and assemblage to Fluxus, Pop, and postmodernism, Saunders’s charts an unexpected path through the medium of painting, as well as a romance with its poetic modes of communicating layers of consciousness.

Raymond Saunders: Flowers from a Black Garden is co-organized by Carnegie Museum of Art and Orange County Museum of Art. Carnegie Museum of Art’s presentation is curated by Eric Crosby, Henry J. Heinz II Director, Carnegie Museum of Art, and Vice President, Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh, with Alyssa Velazquez, assistant curator.

Raymond Saunders lives and works in Oakland, CA. He obtained his BFA from the Carnegie Institute of Technology, before moving to California, where he earned his MFA at the California College of Arts and Crafts. Saunders joined the faculty of California State University East Bay, Hayward, in 1968, eventually becoming an arts professor at California College of the Arts in Oakland. Saunders currently holds the title of professor emeritus from Cal State East Bay in Hayward. He was awarded a Rome Prize Fellowship in 1964, a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1976, and is a two-time recipient of the National Endowment for the Arts Awards (1977, 1984). His work was recently included in the traveling exhibition Soul of a Nation: Art in the Age of Black Power, 1963–1983, organized by Tate Modern, London. He was also included in the traveling exhibition Now Dig This! Art and Black Los Angeles, 1960–1980, organized by the Hammer Museum, Los Angeles. Saunders works are included in the permanent collections of Carnegie Museum of Art, Pittsburgh; the National Gallery of Art, Washington, DC; Museum of Modern Art, New York; Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; Whitney Museum of American Art, New York; Howard University, Washington, DC; Walker Art Center, Minneapolis; Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; Hammer Museum, Los Angeles; San Francisco Museum of Modern Art; Oakland Museum of California, Oakland; and Berkeley Art Museum in Berkeley, CA; among many others.

description: Carnegie Museum of Art’s collection is known for its strength in 18th-century European art. This period is traditionally associated with the Enlightenment, and its intellectual and cultural changes leading to increased individual happiness and freedom. Fault Lines: Art, Imperialism, and the Atlantic World questions the biased coherence of this concept seen from Europe only, foregrounding instead the Atlantic world.

Seen from an Atlantic perspective, the world was geopolitically connected by competitive trade, endemic violence, war, and European increased colonial presence in Africa and the Americas. This exhibition brings together the work of artists who lived within the fluid imperial boundaries of Spanish, Dutch, French, and British Empires to explore the way that art and artists contributed to, reinforced, or undermined European imperial projects.

The exhibition is organized by Marie-Stéphanie Delamaire, curator of European and American art, with Emily Mirales, curatorial assistant.

Carnegie Museum of Art’s exhibition program is supported by the Carnegie Museum of Art Exhibition Fund and The Fellows of Carnegie Museum of Art.

description: Water has been a recurring presence in the work of Charles Harlan (b. 1984, Smyrna, GA), whose meditative sculptures surface various materials and human histories. His readymade objects of choice, which are brought together with minimal alteration, are drawn from industrial, agricultural, and domestic aspects of our built environment. In their original non-art contexts, they have functional use value as components of machinery, manual labor, trade, craftsmanship, or conveyance. Through juxtaposition and assembly, they summon symbolic connotations from which surprising conversations about meaning-making start to emerge. Challenging some of our most basic assumptions about what sculpture can and should be, Harlan’s artworks offer an open field for our own cultural narratives and play of associations.

The exhibition is organized by Eric Crosby, Henry J. Heinz II Director, Carnegie Museum of Art, and Vice President, Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh.

description: In after school, architects, artists, designers, and educators come together to study the state of public education. They contend with institutional spaces, pedagogies, and legacies, and ask questions about representation, creativity, and care. How can a school be liberatory? From itinerant classrooms to cooperative educational experiments, the exhibition participants put forth propositions for a school unbound.

In dialogue with contemporary projects, the exhibition presents archival fragments of histories of public education in the region. The city’s schools have been a place where rights and futures have been imagined and fought for. Common infrastructures for education, curricular reforms, and contestations over the lines that demarcate school districts reveal a continuing process of learning and praxis towards a school that is not yet here. Drawing from regional archives and the museum’s collection, after school builds on these traces of learning spaces and curricular experiments which range from the New Deal programs of the 1930s to Street Academies and the struggles for desegregation and educational justice in the 1960s and 1970s.

after school is curated by Theodossis Issaias, curator at Heinz Architectural Center, and Alyssa Velazquez, assistant curator.

The programs of the Heinz Architectural Center are made possible by the generosity of the Drue Heinz Trust.
