Her cast of zany southern characters and parody country music songs have pushed her to the top of the Spotify and Apple Music charts, earning her a cumulative following of 3.6M+ followers and nearly 2 billion views.
Danae's debut Country/Comedy single "Rode Hard" peaked at No. 5 on the Country Global iTunes Charts, No. 8 on Billboard’s Country Digital Song Sales, No. 22 on Billboard’s Digital Song Sales, and No. 34 on Billboard’s Emerging Artists.
Earlier this year, Danae wrapped her debut comedy tour, which sold out in minutes. The tour has been extended through the end of the year and transitioned theaters. Danae and her wife, Mandie Kaii, host the weekly podcast called The Refined and Rowdy Show, where humor, heart and contrasting perspectives collide as they discuss everything from pop culture to heated issues. The podcast — which launched in Fall 2023 — just recently surpassed 1 million listeners.
True to her multi-hyphenate nature, Danae's passion for acting landed her a role in "Mother Nature and the Doomsday Prepper" (which she just returned from filming in the spring of 2024) and "Summer Camp". Additionally, Danae has co-and-guest starred alongside many of the most notable names in entertainment including Diane Keaton, Kathy Bates, Alfre Woodard, Tanya Christiansen and Josh Peck.

description: “…a perfectly combustible electric-acoustic outfit whose smart, often challenging and unpredictable compositions draw from fusion, postbop and contemporary jazz.” — Jazz Times
Throughout their storied 43-year history, the Yellowjackets have recorded 26 albums, received 16 Grammy® nominations – won 2 – performed countless sold-out tours, and enjoyed worldwide critical acclaim and commercial success.
The Yellowjackets formed in the late 1970’s as the backup band for guitarist Robben Ford. They recorded their first album together in 1980. Shortly after that recording, however, Ford decided to part ways and go in a different musical direction. As a result, the modern day Yellowjackets were formed — a trio with Russell Ferrante, Jimmy Haslip and Ricky Lawson. Since then, and with the addition of Bob Mintzer, the Yellowjackets have gained and maintained prominence as one of jazz’s most influential and loved groups.
Over the years the band has undergone numerous lineup changes. Never failing to rise to the inevitable challenges of adjustment, the Yellowjackets - Russell Ferrante, William Kennedy, Bob Mintzer - have maintained an extraordinarily high quality of musicianship that is the rival of many but a surprise to no one who knows and appreciates the band and their music.
The most recent addition to the band adds Australian bass player Dane Alderson into the mix. With his exceptional rhythmic sensibility and natural disposition toward groove, Dane brings a new energy to the band and adds a youthful approach to the music.
The Yellowjackets album “Raising Our Voice" was released in Fall 2018 and features special guest vocalist Luciana Souza. Their album "Jackets XL with the WDR Big Band" was nominated for a Grammy® in 2021.
Their latest album "Parallel Motion" (2022) also received a Grammy nomination for Best Jazz Instrumental Album and is a true testament to the longevity and resilience of a band who debuted over 40 years ago. Consistently reinventing themselves through elevated instrumentation in their signature electro-acoustic soundscape, the current lineup showcases a collective at their prime.

Piven has also appeared in numerous successful films, including Grosse Pointe Blank, Singles, Very Bad Things, The Family Man, Black Hawk Down, The Kingdom, Heat, PC, Old School, Rock N Rolla, Serendipity, Smokin' Aces, and Runaway Jury.
Piven appears as Joel Lapchick the man responsible for helping Nat “Sweetwater” Clifton break the color barrier in the NBA in 1950 in the movie Sweetwater, which dropped on Angel Studios on September 26th, soon to be available VOD. His next film, The Performance, is an adaptation of an Arthur Miller work due out in theaters at the end of 2024.
He was recently seen in the feature film Last Call opposite Oscar winner Bruce Dern and Orange is the New Black star Taryn Manning. Other recent and upcoming films include American Night opposite Oscar nominee Emile Hirsch, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, which screened at the Venice Film Festival, period drama film The Walk opposite Justin Chatwin and Oscar nominee Terrence Howard, and The System which teamed him up again with Terrence Howard and Tyrese Gibson.
Piven also released the popular podcast “How U Livin’ J Piven,'' where he interviewed influential guests such as Jamie Foxx, Tiffany Haddish, Common, Mark Cuban and UFC stars Rashad Evans and Jorge Masvidal, in an intimate and in-depth format that showcased his dynamic personality in a never-before-seen way. The show is available wherever you get your podcasts.
Piven now tours the country with his successful stand-up comedy show, flexing a comedic muscle that few actors have been able to transition over to. The tour will see him across the entire continental U.S. and also take him internationally to the U.K. and beyond.

Working with the leadership of Allegheny County and with funding from the Drue Heinz Trust, our organization coordinated with the former jail’s Deputy Warden Ed Urban and the Allegheny County Juvenile Court to preserve one portion of the cell blocks of the historic jail to create the Old Allegheny County Jail Museum.
The Jail Museum, located in Downtown — at 440 Ross Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15219 — opened in 2005.
To access the Museum: Enter the Family Court building through the main entrance on Ross Street. You will then be processed through a security checkpoint.   The museum is located to the left of Security across from the cafe room.

This year’s competition will be at the museum on March 15-16 and explore the theme, “Rights & Responsibilities in History.”
National History Day (NHD) draws upon a unique historical theme each year and encourages middle school and high school students to research history in an exciting and creative way. Students can enter one of five categories—paper, performance, documentary, exhibit, or website. Students may enter as individuals or in teams of 2-5 for all categories except paper, in which students must compete individually. Students are split into a junior division (grades 6-8 on Saturday, March 15) and senior division (grades 9-12 on Sunday, March 16).
Each category is judged separately. First, second, and third place winners from the junior and senior divisions move on to the state competition. The top winners from the state competition then move on to the national competition in June.

description: With approximately 1/5th of the Pittsburgh metropolitan community claiming Irish heritage, it is no wonder the Steel City boasts one of the largest St. Patrick’s Day celebrations in the country. Irish step dancers, marching bands, military members, community organizations, and even Punxsutawney Phil are just a few of the participants that march down Grant Street every year on the Saturday before St. Patrick’s Day. Rain, hail, or even blizzard conditions cannot stop us from celebrating our Irish pride, especially when “everyone is Irish for the day.”
What began more than 150 years ago as a way to honor the patron saint of Ireland has evolved into a city-wide celebration of the pride that comes from being Irish. We welcome you to join us, first for mass at Old St. Patrick’s in the Strip, and then along the parade route. Wear your green (or black and gold), and help us celebrate!

This year’s competition will be at the museum on March 15-16 and explore the theme, “Rights & Responsibilities in History.”
National History Day (NHD) draws upon a unique historical theme each year and encourages middle school and high school students to research history in an exciting and creative way. Students can enter one of five categories—paper, performance, documentary, exhibit, or website. Students may enter as individuals or in teams of 2-5 for all categories except paper, in which students must compete individually. Students are split into a junior division (grades 6-8 on Saturday, March 15) and senior division (grades 9-12 on Sunday, March 16).
Each category is judged separately. First, second, and third place winners from the junior and senior divisions move on to the state competition. The top winners from the state competition then move on to the national competition in June.

description: With deadpan, absurdist charm, Manitoban filmmaker Matthew Rankin triangulates a group of interconnected storylines set in a wintry, bleakly beautiful Winnipeg. Two kids discover a bank note frozen in a block of ice, which they hope to retrieve to buy their classmates a new pair of glasses. A tour guide brings befuddled visitors on a walking tour of the city’s modest environs. A melancholy man (Rankin, in an autobiographical role) returns home from Montreal to reunite with his family after many years. Imagining a city in which Farsi is the predominant language, Rankin’s visually and narratively inventive film was inspired by Iranian films of the 1970s, frequently humanistic children’s fables, in this case transferred to a world of beige, concrete brutalist buildings and increasingly surreal, Tati-esque humor.

description: Set in 1931 Berlin, M is the chilling tale of serial child murderer Hans Beckert (Peter Lorre, in a star-defining performance) and the community he terrorizes, its various strata and conceptions of justice. Opening with an unsolved murder, the film depicts a frantic hunt for the killer. With the sanctioned wheels of the lawful justice system turning, the city's criminal underworld begins to have difficulties conducting business as usual. The streets are thick with police on high alert, conducting raids at every opportunity. In response, the city's mobsters devise a vigilante plan to capture the murderer and bring him to justice themselves. The first sound film of German-Austrian master Fritz Lang, M has come to be considered the original psychological thriller, the begetter of what would come to be known as film noir — and a profound exploration of crime, punishment and justice

location: Harris Theater
809 Liberty Ave
Pittsburgh, PA 15222
description: The lush and breathtaking beauty of the Alps, filmed with painterly grace under natural light from frigid winter to redemptive spring, provides the physical and emotional backdrop for ‘Vermiglio,’ Maura Delpero’s visionary film, which won the Silver Lion at the 2024 Venice Film Festival. This singular portrait of a sprawling family, set in the small, mountainous village of Vermiglio during the waning days of WWII, follows a series of dramatic, consequential events after the arrival of a taciturn Sicilian soldier (Giuseppe De Domenico), who hides out in town after deserting the army. While there, the soldier develops a romance with the family's eldest daughter, Lucia (Martina Scrinzi). ‘Vermiglio’ shows the lives of a provincial family in a remote village suspended in time by the customs of a fading era. Conjuring stories from her own family’s past, Delpero creates a deeply personal and human tale that recalls the great neorealist movement in Italian cinema, but through Lucia’s perspective ‘Vermiglio’ feels distinct and novel. Italy’s Official Selection for the 2025 Academy Awards.

description: This star studded tribute brings into focus the dazzling, complex period of Liza Minnelli’s life starting in the 1970s, just after the tragic death of her mother Judy Garland—as she confronts a range of personal and professional challenges on the way to becoming a bona fide legend. Over these years, Liza seeks out extraordinary mentors: KayThompson, Fred Ebb, Charles Aznavour, Halston, and Bob Fosse. With insightful participation from a coterie of colleagues such as Michael Feinstein, Mia Farrow, Ben Vereen, Joel Grey and the late Chita Rivera, along with the revelatory participation by the star herself, the film illuminates the contradiction of Liza Minnelli: her privilege and struggle, strength and vulnerability, unreal expectations and towering talent–the friction of which fueled her stunning rise, resilience and her enduring place as one of thegreatest, most original performers in the history of entertainment.

Our tour guide, Ben Seidman combines sleight of hand and psychological deception to cheat at cards, pick your pockets, and demonstrate the importance of using our powers for good. At its core, Good Charlatan questions the existence of free will and reimagines how one simple lie can unfold into a spiral of truth.
Ben Seidman guest-starred on the Netflix series Brainchild, produced by Pharrell, and starred in both Vanity Fair and WIRED’s “Experts React” series, discussing magic, sleight of hand, and pickpocketing. Ben appeared in the Vanderpump Rules Season 9 premiere, starred in two specials on Travel Channel, and appeared twice on Penn & Teller: Fool Us. While known for large events, Ben also creates amazement at small private parties, including performances for Christina Aguilera, Woody Harrelson, and Zedd. He has dazzled CEOs, senators, and the late-great Robin Williams.
Seidman was the only person in history to be named the Resident Magician at Mandalay Bay Resort in Las Vegas. He was awarded the Princess Cruises “Entertainer of the Year” award and consulted on three seasons of Mindfreak on A&E, designing illusions for Criss Angel. Seidman taught magic to Johnny Knoxville and consulted on multiple feature films in the Jackass franchise. Internationally, he wrote and directed magic for SVT, the biggest TV channel in Sweden.

The High Kings formed in June 2007 when Brian, Darren, Finbarr and former member Martin Furey were asked to join a brand new Irish ballad group by David Kavanagh after he had noticed a gap in the market for a band specialising in traditional Irish music.
It didn’t take long during there first studio rehearsal for them to realise that the way their individual voices blended together, that they were onto something special. The High Kings play 13 instruments between them creating the unique sound and atmosphere that they still showcase to this day. This was confirmed when their self-titled debut album reached number 2 on the world Billboard Music chart. In March 2009 The High Kings played 5 consecutive sold out shows to a packed audience in Dublin’s Olympia Theatre.
Mary Black is delighted to be going back to the USA in 2025 for the first time in 8 years. Mary has become a dominant presence in Irish music, both at home and abroad, bringing her songs and music, to growing numbers of fans, not just in Ireland where she has been a household name for decades, but all over the world. As an award-winning solo artist with multiple chart-topping and critically acclaimed albums, Mary Black has been celebrated by a faithful public as well as fellow artists many of whom she has performed and recorded with over the years, including Emmylou Harris, Mary Chapin Carpenter, Joan Baez and Van Morrison (celebrated in her latest album ‘Duets'). Last year Mary received an Honorary Doctorate in Literature from UCD and RTÉ presented her with the Lifetime Achievement Award at the RTÉ Radio 1 Folk Awards. Mary and her legendary band will celebrate her career playing favourite songs from her extensive catalogue, songs that we’ve come to know and love over the years.

The building and museum are handicap accessible.
PHLF docents are on hand to tell you the story of the former Allegheny County Jail. Completed in 1886 to the designs of Boston architect H. H. Richardson, it closed on July 27, 1995. The building was then renovated between 1995 and 2001 and adapted for a new use as the Family Division of the Allegheny County Court of Common Pleas.
Working with the leadership of Allegheny County and with funding from the Drue Heinz Trust, our organization coordinated with the former jail’s Deputy Warden Ed Urban and the Allegheny County Juvenile Court to preserve one portion of the cell blocks of the historic jail to create the Old Allegheny County Jail Museum.
The Jail Museum, located in Downtown — at 440 Ross Street, Pittsburgh, PA 15219 — opened in 2005.
To access the Museum: Enter the Family Court building through the main entrance on Ross Street. You will then be processed through a security checkpoint.   The museum is located to the left of Security across from the cafe room.
The use of cameras is NOT permitted.

At the height of the McCarthy era, naive college graduate Timothy Laughlin comes to Washington eager to join the crusade against communism. But a chance encounter with a handsome State Department official, Hawkins Fuller, leads to Tim’s first job—and his first relationship with a man.
Under the threat of increased government scrutiny, this complicated and clandestine affair will put both men’s loyalties and convictions to the ultimate test. As the poisonous political climate pollutes their relationship, love becomes a casualty of what it takes to “play the game” in Washington.
Based on Thomas Mallon’s 2007 gut-wrenching novel, Fellow Travelers was praised as “a near-perfect example of fast-flowing musical drama” by The New York Times and is already widely considered a contemporary classic.
