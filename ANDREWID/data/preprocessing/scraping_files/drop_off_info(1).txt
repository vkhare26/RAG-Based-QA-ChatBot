Recycling Contamination, and Why It Matters?

One of the biggest challenges facing recycling right now is contamination by wishful recycling or “wish-cycling”. This happens when non-recyclable objects are placed in the recycling bin with the wish it will be recycled. Additionally, recycling contamination occurs when food residue, liquids, and unacceptable materials (such as batteries, sharps, extra plastic bags, food waste, and greasy pizza boxes), are placed into the recycling can. Contaminants not only degrade the materials, boosting costs, but they can potentially cause harm to the Material Recovery Facility (MRF) and city employees.


- Bagged recyclables
- Plastic bags
- Plastic films
- Plastic packaging
- Electronics
- Hazardous waste
- Styrofoam
- Greasy pizza boxes
- Food waste
- Durable goods
While these items arenot acceptedat the drop-offs,please click here for waste disposal resources.

Zero Waste

Pittsburgh's Journey to Zero Waste
One of the greenest and most visible ways to manage materials sustainability is to implement the tactics of Zero Waste.
The City of Pittsburgh is working to increase its diversion and strive for Zero Waste by 2030. In an effort to accomplish this goal, it will take city-wide participation from all sectors to eliminate products that are "destined for landfill." The production and disposal of materials result in broad environmental and social impacts associated with obtaining raw materials, manufacturing and emissions from landfills.
The Zero Waste International Alliance defines zero waste as the diversion of at least 90% of waste from landfills or incineration. With help from 100 Resilient Cities, the City of Pittsburgh has developed aRoadmap to Zero Waste(PDF, 602KB), laying out a strategic plan to achieve this 90% diversion rate city-wide by 2030.

How Will We Get There?



- Reducing waste in commercial establishments
- Reducing waste at events
- Engaging Pittsburgh's residents, businesses, and institutions in Zero Waste
- Exploring new ways to reduce and divert waste
All sectors have the opportunity to practice waste avoidance, reduce single-use plastics, and compost with some dedication and practice. The City of Pittsburgh encourages everyone to find viable ways to eliminate waste going in and out of their homes, schools, institutions, and facilities.

Zero Waste Resources

Below are several vendors, consultants, and establishments that can help you reduce your waste!
