Join the History Center for the region’s National History Day competition.

Thousands of students participate in National History Day each year. The Heinz History Center is proud to be the regional home for this competition, serving students from Allegheny, Washington, Greene, Fayette, Westmoreland, and Somerset counties.

This year’s competition will be at the museum on March 15-16 and explore the theme, “Rights & Responsibilities in History.”

National History Day (NHD) draws upon a unique historical theme each year and encourages middle school and high school students to research history in an exciting and creative way. Students can enter one of five categories—paper, performance, documentary, exhibit, or website. Students may enter as individuals or in teams of 2-5 for all categories except paper, in which students must compete individually. Students are split into a junior division (grades 6-8 on Saturday, March 15) and senior division (grades 9-12 on Sunday, March 16).

Each category is judged separately. First, second, and third place winners from the junior and senior divisions move on to the state competition. The top winners from the state competition then move on to the national competition in June.

Celebrate the joy of girlhood during a multigenerational celebration of storytelling and history.

Presented in partnership with the University of Pittsburgh’s Dietrich School of Arts and Sciences, this special day focused on America’s favorite historical dolls will feature a book talk with three American Girl book series authors, a delightful tea party, paper doll making, and more.

The trio will discuss how they framed important historical events and issues for younger audiences while also imparting lessons of resilience, friendship, and empowerment throughout.

Ahead of the book talk, kids and kids-at-heart are invited (with their dolls!) to an enchanting tea party that Samantha, Molly, and Felicity would be proud of! Enjoy light refreshments and imaginative play while you sip, savor, and socialize.

Join Fort Pitt Museum for an afternoon with author C. Prentiss Orr.

The Fort Pitt Museum will host award-winning author, editor, and publisher C. Prentiss Orr to discuss his book, “The Surveyor and the Silversmith.”

Inside “The Surveyor and the Silversmith,” Orr offers a deep dive into the complex world of land speculation and surveying in the Ohio Country. Readers will learn how early surveyors and investors shaped the frontier, fueling expansion and conflict in the region.

Following the lecture, Orr will sign books for attendees. The program will take place in the Fort Pitt Auditorium on the museum’s first floor.

Orr is the principal author and editor of the popular illustrated reference book, “Pittsburgh Born, Pittsburgh Bred: 500 of the More Famous People Who Have Called Pittsburgh Home,” chosen by the Heinz History Center as the official publication to celebrate Pittsburgh’s 250th anniversary.

He has written dozens of Pittsburgh biographies as editor and publisher of Allegheny Cemetery’s Heritage newsletter and published two local history books with the late C. Hax McCullough.

Orr also was an editor of “The Power of Pittsburgh,” published by Towery Books as the centerpiece of a larger economic development campaign he directed for the Allegheny Conference on Community Development. A former theatre marketing professional and advertising creative director for more than 30 years, in 2005, Prentiss also co-founded Pennsylvania Pure Distilleries, the first vodka distillery in Pennsylvania and makers of Boyd & Blair Potato Vodka.

The 2025 History Maker Honorees will be announced soon – check this space for updates!

The 32nd annual History Makers Award Dinner, presented by BNY and Citizens, will take place on Thursday, June 5, at the Heinz History Center.

Since 1992, the Heinz History Center has honored exceptional individuals whose accomplishments, while rooted here in Western Pa., transcend geographic bounds. History Makers profoundly contribute to the innovative history and collective heritage of our region and represent a commitment to excellence that has defined our community. The History Center is proud to celebrate such individuals and to share their remarkable stories.

Funding raised from the Award Dinner helps to preserve our regional history for future generations and provide a space where experiences and learning moments for all ages help make memories that last a lifetime. The History Center tells the stories of Western Pennsylvanians whose hard work, innovation, enterprise, creativity, and courage improved the world and still serves to guide and inspire us today. Like our History Makers, we are encouraged (but not surprised) by stories of Pittsburgh’s can-do spirit and kindness. After all—we are home to “Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood.”
