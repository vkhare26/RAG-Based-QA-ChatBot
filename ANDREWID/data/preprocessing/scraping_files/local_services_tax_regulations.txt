SECTION 201 – TIME FRAME 
A Local Services Tax has been levied pursuant to the City Code, Title II, Article VII, Chapter 252, 
for the period January 1 thru December 31 for the purposes of supplementing the funds for (1) 
Police, Fire and/or Emergency services; (2) road construction and/or maintenance; or (3) 
reduction of property taxes. This tax was levied for the privilege of engaging in an occupation 
within the city for each calendar year. It shall be paid over to the Treasurer as set forth in 
Chapter 252. Each natural person who engages in an occupation shall pay a tax in the amount 
of $52 in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 252 of the City Code. 
RATE OF TAX –$52 – A person subject to the Local Services Tax shall be assessed a pro rata 
share of the tax for each payroll period in which the person is engaging in an occupation. The 
pro rata share shall be determined by dividing the rate of the Local Services Tax levied for the 
calendar year by the number of payroll periods established by the employer for the calendar 
year. Example:  $52/26 pay periods equal $2 per pay.  Employers are required to remit the  
Local Services Tax thirty days after the end of each quarter of a calendar year. For purposes of 
this tax, sole proprietors and partners shall be deemed to be employees. 
The situs of the Local Services Tax shall be the place of employment, but, in the event a person 
is engaged in more than one occupation or municipality at the same time, the priority of claim to 
collect such tax shall be the municipality in which a person is principally employed for the pay 
periods in question. 
Beginning in 2008 a person seeking to claim an exemption from the Local Services Tax may 
annually file an exemption certificate with his employer. The employee shall attach to the 
exemption certificate a copy of all the employees last pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment 
within the political subdivision for the year prior to the calendar year. 
Exemption certificates can be downloaded at www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/finance 
Beginning in 2008, the following persons are exempt from this tax: (1) any person whose total 
earned income and net profits from all sources within the City is less than twelve thousand 
dollars ($12,000) for the calendar year; (2) any person who served in any war or armed conflict 
in which the United States was engaged and is honorably discharged or released under honorable 
circumstances from active service if, as a result of military service, the person is blind, paraplegic 
or a double or quadruple amputee or has a service connected disability declared by the United 
States Veteran’s Administration or its successor to be a total one hundred percent permanent 
disability; or ( 3 ) any person who serves as a member of a reserve component of the armed 
forces and is called to active duty at any time during the taxable year. For purposes of this 
subsection, “reserve component of the armed forces” shall mean the United States Army 
Reserve, United States Navy Reserve, United States Marine Corps Reserve, United States 
Coast Guard Reserve, United States Air Force Reserve, The Pennsylvania Army National 
Guard or the Pennsylvania Air National Guard.

EXAMPLES FOR LOCAL SERVICE TAX (LST) 
 
1. 
How is the LST deducted from the employee’s pay and remitted to the City? Example, 
employees work full time in the City and all employees earn $12,000 or more.  What is  
the employer’s responsibility? 
ANSWER:  The employer is required to withhold the pro-rata share of the tax by dividing 
$52 by the number of payroll periods established by the employer for the calendar year. 
The $52 tax would be collected at $1 per week for taxpayers paid weekly or at $4.33 per 
month for taxpayers paid monthly. When calculating the pro-rata share, employers are 
required to round down to the nearest one-hundredth of a dollar. 
The employer must remit the LST quarterly. The LST form is provided by the City. The  
tax should be paid the month following the end of each quarter. The LST forms can be 
downloaded at www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/finance 
2. 
At the beginning of the year, an employee expects to earn a total of $10,000 in the City  
for the entire calendar year. Should the employer withhold the LST? 
ANSWER: No. If an employee files an exemption certificate with his employer stating that 
he will earn less than $12,000 for the entire year, the employer is not required to  
withhold the LST.  The employer is required to have the exemption certificate available  
for employees to complete. 
The exemption certificate can be downloaded at www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/finance 
3. 
A new hire files an exemption certificate with his employer. The employer and his 
employee realize with 13 weeks left in the year that he will earn $12,000 because he is 
working more hours than anticipated. He is paid weekly. Is his employer responsible for 
withholding the LST now? 
ANSWER: Yes. After the employer realizes that the employee will  earn  $12,000  or 
more, the employer must withhold $40 ($39 + $1) from the next pay to catch-up then 
$1.00 a pay for the remaining 12 pays for a grand total of $52. 
4. 
Employee has two part-time jobs; one located in the City which pays him $8,000 a year 
and another in Municipality “A” that pays him $7,000 a year. Does this person need to  
pay the LST? 
ANSWER: No.  The taxpayer should file an exemption certificate with both employers  
and have no LST deducted. The Taxpayer is not subject to the LST since he did not earn 
$12,000 in any single municipality. If the tax was withheld the employee could file a  
refund claim with each municipality after January 31 of the following year. The refund 
request form can be downloaded at www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/finance - the form is 
listed as LST REFUND FORM. 
5. 
An individual works January thru June in the City and July thru December in Municipality 
“A”. He earns $10,000 a month at both jobs and is paid once a week. What is his liability 
to Pittsburgh? 
ANSWER: His employer in the City should withhold $1 a week for 26 pay periods and 
remit $26 along with his other employees’ deductions to the City. Municipality “A” would 
be entitled to the LST for the 2nd half of the year. The employee should provide proof of 
LST paid for the first half of the year to Municipality “A”. 

-7- 
 
6. 
An individual works July thru December in the City. He did not work January thru June, 
anywhere. He earns $10,000 a month. Does he owe the $52 LST to the City? 
ANSWER: Yes. His employer knows that this employee is over  the  $12,000  low  
income exemption level. No exemption certificate has been filed. The $52 may be 
prorated for the rest of the year; however the employer should withhold $52 because that 
is what the employee owes. 
SECOND OPTION: The employer at his option may also deduct a lump sum equal to the 
prior periods that were missed. This payroll deduction should also include the current 
payroll deduction that he and his co-workers are liable for. For example, if he is paid 
once a week, he would add $1 to his lump sum prior liability, and this would be 
deducted from one paycheck. 
7. 
An employee has 2 jobs and both are part time. Both started at the beginning of January. 
Job #1 is in the City and pays the employee $1,000 a month. Job #2 is in Municipality “A” 
and paid the taxpayer $500. Where should the tax be paid? 
ANSWER: Since both jobs started at the same time, the job that pays the employee the 
most should be considered his principal job and in this case it would be the City. The LST 
should be paid to the City. The employee should file an exemption certificate with 
Municipality “A” or proof that his principal employer is located in the City. 
8. 
On January 1, an employee worked for an employer in Municipality “A” and paid $10. In 
June the employee started a new job in the City and will make over $12,000 at this job.   
Is the employer required to withhold the LST from the employee? 
ANSWER: Yes. The employer must still withhold $42 ($52 less $ 10 previously paid) 
if the employee provides proof that the $10 was paid to Municipality “A”. Then the 
employer must pro-rate the $42  based on the remaining payroll  periods. 
SECOND OPTION: The employer at his option may also deduct a lump sum equal to the 
prior periods that were missed. This payroll deduction should also include the current 
payroll deduction that he and his co-workers are liable for. For example, if he is paid 
once a week, he would add $1 to his lump sum prior liability, and this would be 
deducted from one paycheck. 
9. 
An employee files his exemption certificate late. The employer has already withheld $52. 
Can the employee apply for a refund? 
ANSWER: Yes. The employee should request the refund from the employer. It is 
permissible and recommended that his employer refund the current year LST and make 
an adjustment for their next quarterly remittance to the City for the current year. 
If the employer does not refund the LST, the employee can apply for a refund from the 
City after the employer’s fourth quarter payment and summary form is filed at the end of 
January of the following year (see Section 301(j)). 
The City is not required to pay interest until 75 days after the fourth quarter or when the 
taxpayer files for a refund, whichever is later.

10. 
Employee works 4 months in the City and earns $20,000. His employer  is  located 
outside the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Is the employee required to pay the $52 
LST? 
ANSWER:   Yes. 
11. 
Is a self-employed person or a  partner who has an office in the City or who works out  
of his home  located in the City subject to the LST? 
ANSWER: 
Yes.   A self-employed person or partner is subject to the $52   LST.  The 
tax may be  prorated and paid quarterly. 
 
ARTICLE III 
COLLECTION AT SOURCE 
SECTION 301 – COLLECTION THROUGH EMPLOYERS 
a. 
Every employer not registered with the City shall, within 15 days after first becoming an 
employer, register with the City the employer’s name, address and such other information 
as the City may require. 
b. 
All employers and self-employed individuals are required to collect the Local Services Tax 
from all employees engaged in an occupation within the City, unless the employee files  
an Exemption certificate with the employer. Exemption certificates must indicate a basis 
for exemption and must be retained for 3 years. 
c. 
Employers are required to remit the Local Services Tax within thirty (30) days after the 
end of each quarter of a calendar year. For purposes of this tax, sole proprietors and 
partners shall be deemed to be employees. 
WHEN TO FILE AND PAY – The employer shall file a return of taxes deducted for each 
three-month period (quarter) on or before the last day of the month following each three- 
month period. 
FIRST QUARTER (03): 
January 1 thru March 31 (due April 30) 
SECOND QUARTER (06): 
April 1 thru June 30 (due July 31) 
THIRD QUARTER (09): 
July 1 thru September 30 (due October 31) 
FOURTH QUARTER (12): 
October 1 thru December 31 (due January 31) 
d. 
Any employer, who discontinues business or ceases operation before December 31 of 
the current tax year, shall within fifteen (15) days after discontinuing business or ceasing 
operation, file the return hereinabove required and pay the tax to the Treasurer. 
e. 
The failure of any employer to deduct the tax shall not relieve the employee from the duty 
to file a return and pay the tax. The employee must first contact the City of Pittsburgh 
Finance Department at 412-255-2510 then file an LS-3 form. No employer shall be held 
liable for failure to withhold the Local Services Tax to a political subdivision if the failure to 
withhold taxes arises from incorrect information submitted by the employee as to the 
employee’s place or places of employment. Any employer who fails to deduct the tax as 
required by this section, or who fails to pay the tax to the Treasurer, shall be liable for 
such tax in full. 

-8- 
 
As to employees who present official receipts evidencing prior payment of the tax either 
directly or by collection through other employers in Pennsylvania, the employer shall not 
deduct the tax but shall maintain adequate records concerning the employees. 
f. 
The employer must list on the employee’s pay stub how much was withheld and list the 
municipality it was paid to. List PITTSBURGH as “PGH”. 
g. 
Upfront Exemption. Employers are required to discontinue withholding the LST if an 
employee provides an exemption certificate showing that he has earned income and/or 
net profits of less than $12,000. The exemption certificate must verify that the employee 
reasonably expects to receive earned income and/or net profits of less than $12,000 from 
all sources within the City for the calendar year for which the exemption certificate is filed. 
A copy of the employee’s final pay stubs or W-2 forms from employment within Pittsburgh 
for the year prior to the calendar year for which the employee is requesting an exemption 
must be attached to the exemption certificate. Employers must make upfront exemption 
forms readily available to employees at all times and provide new employees with the 
forms at the time of hiring. Employers are relieved of liability due to incorrect information 
on the exemption certificate completed by the employee. 
Employers are only required to withhold the LST on a payroll period basis for those 
payroll periods in which the taxpayer is employed. However, when two or more employers 
employ a taxpayer in a payroll period, an employer is not required to withhold the LST if 
the taxpayer provides a pay stub from his/her principal employer accompanied by an 
employee statement of principal employment that the pay stub is from the taxpayer’s 
principal employer and that the taxpayer will notify the employer of any change in 
employment. Employers are relieved of liability for the tax if they fail to withhold the tax due 
to incorrect information provided by the taxpayer regarding the taxpayer’s principal 
employer. 
h. 
Military Exemption. Employers must exempt from the LST: (1) members of a reserve 
component of the armed forces called to active duty and (2) honorably discharged 
veterans who served in any war or armed conflict who are blind, paraplegic, or a double 
or quadruple amputee as a result of military service or who are 100% disabled from a 
service-connected disability. 
i. 
Restoration of Withholding. Employers must “restart” withholding the LST from an 
employee who files an exemption certificate in the following  circumstances: 
 If instructed to do so by the political subdivision levying the LST; 
 If notified by the employee that he is no longer eligible for the exemption; or 
 If the employer pays the employee $12,000 or more for the calendar year. 
Employers “restart” withholding of the LST by withholding (1) a “catch-up” lump sum  
equal to the amount of tax that was not withheld from the employee as a result of the 
exemption; and (2) the same amount per payroll period that is withheld from other 
employees. 
j. 
The employer must attach a summary on a CD or hard copy with the fourth quarter 
payment listing the following information: 
 Employer’s name, address in Pittsburgh, Federal ID number, and the employer’s City 
account number. 

-9- 
 
 The summary must include an employee’s name, Social Security number, wages, 
address and the amount of Local Service Tax withheld and paid to Pittsburgh for the 
complete calendar year. 
 Please see the LST tax form at www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/finance for the format to 
use on CD. 
 Concurrent Employment. If a taxpayer has two or more jobs in different political 
subdivisions during a payroll period, the priority of claim to collect the LST is as 
follows: 
1. Where the taxpayer maintains his principal office or is principally employed; 
2. Where the taxpayer resides and works; and 
3. Where the taxpayer is employed that is nearest in miles to the taxpayer’s home. 
k. 
If any employer fails or refuses to pay over to the Treasurer any tax required to be 
withheld under this section by the due date, a penalty of 5% for every month or fraction 
thereof that the tax remains unpaid shall be added and collected, the penalty is capped at 
50%. Interest at the rate of twelve percent (12%) per annum on the amount of tax unpaid 
for each month or fraction of a month that tax remains unpaid shall be added and 
collected. 
SECTION 302 – DIRECT PAYMENT BY TAXPAYER 
Every taxpayer who is self-employed, a partner, or any taxpayer that did not have the tax 
withheld for any other reason, shall file a LS-3 form and shall pay the tax directly to the 
Treasurer. The tax is $52 and should be pro-rated and paid on a quarterly basis. Taxpayers shall 
file and pay the tax 30 days after the end of each quarter. 
SECTION 303 – LIABILITY OF EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES 
Any employer required to withhold the tax in accordance with the City Code and with these 
Regulations shall be personally liable for payment of the tax in the event he fails, refuses or 
neglects to withhold or transmit the tax or any portion thereof, in addition to the interest and 
penalties. Any taxes deducted and withheld from employees, plus any penalties and interest 
thereon, constitute a trust fund for the benefit of the City. The failure to timely remit such funds 
allows the City to collect such trust funds from the employer, the employer’s representative, or 
any other person receiving such trust funds.  53 P.S. § 6924.705(b)(1). 
The failure or omission of any employer to make the correct deductions required by this section 
shall not relieve any employee from the payment of the tax or the balance determined to be due, 
together with penalty and interest from the date the tax was due, or from complying with the 
requirements of the Code relating to the filing of declarations and returns. 
ARTICLE IV 
ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT 
SECTION 401 – POWERS AND DUTIES OF TREASURER 
a. 
It shall be the duty of the Treasurer to collect and receive the taxes, fines, and penalties 
imposed in accordance with the City Code, Title II, Article VII, Chapter 252. It shall also  
be the duty of the Treasurer to keep a record showing the date of such receipt. 
b. 
The Treasurer is charged with the administration and enforcement of the provisions of the 
City Code, and is empowered to prescribe, adopt, promulgate and enforce rules and 
regulations relating to any matter pertaining to the administration and enforcement of the 
Code, including provisions for the reexamination and corrections of declarations and

-10- 
 
administration of the Code. 
 
c.

SECTION 402 – EXAMINATION OF BOOKS AND RECORDS OF TAXPAYERS AND 
EMPLOYERS 
a. 
Agents designated by the Treasurer are hereby authorized to examine the books, papers 
and records of any employer or supposed employer, or of any taxpayer or supposed 
taxpayer, in order to verify the accuracy of any declaration or return, or if no declaration  
or return was filed, to ascertain the tax due. Every employer or supposed employer, and 
every taxpayer or supposed taxpayer, is hereby directed and required to give to the 
Treasurer, or to any agent designated by him, the means, facilities and opportunity for 
such examinations and investigations, as are hereby authorized. 
b. 
If records are not available in the City to support the returns which were filed or which 
should have been filed, the taxpayer will be required to make them available to the 
Treasurer either by producing them in a City location or by paying for the expenses 
incurred by the Treasurer in traveling to the place where the records are regularly kept. 
c. 
A taxpayer or employer has 30 days from the mailing date to respond to written requests 
for information from the City or its agents, unless an extension of time is granted in

as otherwise provided by law. 53 Pa.C.S. § 8437. 
 
SECTION 403 – RECORDS TO BE KEPT BY THE EMPLOYER 
Employers are required to keep such records, including exemption certificates, which will enable 
the filing of true and accurate returns of the Local Services Tax (LS-1 and LS-3). Such records 
shall be preserved for a period of not less than three (3) years from the filing date or due date, 
whichever is later, in order to enable the Treasurer or any designated agent to verify the 
correctness of the declarations or returns filed. 
 
SECTION 404 - AUDITS 
If, as a result of an examination conducted by the Treasurer, a return is found to be incorrect,  
the Treasurer is authorized to assess and collect any underpayments of the Local Services Tax. 
If no return has been filed and a tax is found to be due, the tax actually due may be assessed 
and collected with or without the formality of obtaining a return from the taxpayer. Deficiency 
assessments (i.e., where taxpayer has filed a return in good faith but is found to owe additional 
tax) shall include taxes for three (3) years prior to the date when the deficiency is assessed.

ARTICLE V 
SUITS FOR TAX COLLECTIONS, VIOLATIONS, FINES, INTEREST & PENALTIES 
SECTION 501 – REMEDIES NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE 
The remedies provided in Section 502 or Section 505 are not mutually exclusive. The utilization 
by the Treasurer of one remedy does not preclude utilization of the other.  Moreover, use     
of either or both of the remedies provided in these Sections does not preclude the use by the 
City of any other legal or administrative procedure which can bring about compliance by the 
taxpayer with the provisions of Chapter 252 of the Code. 
SECTION 502 – SUITS FOR RECOVERY OF UNPAID TAXES 
The Treasurer may sue in the name of the City, in law or in equity, for the recovery of those 
taxes due and unpaid under the provisions of the Local Services Tax, to compel the production 
of records or to enforce any other provisions of the Code, Title II, Article I, Chapter 211. 
Once it has been determined that that a taxpayer owes a tax, the Treasurer will take all actions 
legally permitted to enforce its claim. Such action may include obtaining additional information, 
auditing taxpayer records, entering into a settlement of the disputed amount of the tax, or 
obtaining liens on the taxpayer’s property, wage attachments, levies, and seizures and sales 
of the taxpayer’s property in appropriate circumstances. The Treasurer may enter into a written 
agreement with the taxpayer for payment of the tax in installments if the Treasurer believes 
that such an agreement will facilitate collection. The Treasurer may also impose interest and 
applicable penalties on the tax due, and may seek criminal charges in appropriate 
circumstances.  See, Local Tax Enabling Act, 53 P.S. § 6924.702. 
SECTION 503 - LIMITATIONS 
a. 
The following periods of limitations shall apply to suits for collection of taxes. 
1. Where a return was filed  but no tax paid, any suit  brought to recover the  tax due   
and unpaid shall begin within three (3) years after the return was due or filed, 
whichever is  later. 
2. In the case of a deficiency assessment, within three (3) years after the assessment  
has  been made. 
b. 
The limitations set forth in paragraph (a) should not prevent the institution of a suit for 
the collection of any tax due or determined to be due in the following cases: 
1. When no return was filed, there is no limitation. 
2. When the return is fraudulent, there is no limitation. 
3. When there is an understatement of tax liability of twenty-five percent (25%) or more, 
and not due to fraud, suit must begin within six (6) years.

Deficiency assessments (i.e., where taxpayer has filed a return in good faith but is found 
to owe additional tax) shall include taxes for three  (3) years prior to  the  date  when 
the deficiency is assessed. Where no return was filed, there shall be no limit to the 
period of assessment. A return filed before the due date is deemed to be filed on the 
due date.

SECTION 504 – PENALTY AND INTEREST 
a. 
If for any reason the Local Services Tax is not paid when due, interest at the rate       
of twelve percent (12%) per annum on the amount of tax and an additional penalty of 
five percent (5%) per month for each month or fraction of a month during the period in 
which the tax remains unpaid shall be added to the tax. 53 P.S. § 6924.706. The 
penalty shall not exceed fifty percent (50%). In no event shall the interest rate 
assessed exceed the maximum rate allowed by the Municipal Claims and Tax Liens 
Act, 53 P.S. § 7143, or applicable law. 
b. 
Penalty and Interest on Deficiency Assessment. On any additional tax determined to 
be due as a result of a deficiency assessment, penalty and interest will be assessed 
from the day the tax should have been paid to the date of payment. Penalty and 
interest is calculated as described in paragraph (a) above. Where suit is brought for 
the recovery of such tax, the person  liable therefore shall,  in  addition, be liable for  
the costs of collection and the interest and penalties herein imposed. A person’s belief 
that no tax is due and owing, or the failure of any person to receive or obtain the forms 
required for making the returns required under the City Code, Chapter 211, is not a 
valid defense to the imposition  of  penalties herein for violation.  Good faith shall not 
be a defense to the imposition of penalty. 
 
SECTION 505 – FINES AND PENALTIES FOR VIOLATION OF APPLICABLE PROVISIONS 
OF TITLE TWO, PITTSBURGH CODE 
a. 
Violations – No person shall: 
1. Fail, neglect, or refuse to make any declaration or file a return required under the City 
Code; 
2. Refuse to permit the Treasurer or his/her designee to examine the books, records or 
accounts of any business, taxable or otherwise, to determine liability; 
3. Make any incomplete, false or fraudulent return or attempt to do anything to avoid full 
disclosure of the amount of tax due to avoid payment in whole or in part, of the Local 
Services Tax; 
4. Divulge information, which is confidential under Chapter 201.06 of the Code; or 
5. Fail to make any payment when it is due. 
b. 
Fines 
1. When a person has been adjudged in violation of the applicable provisions by a member 
of the minor judiciary, the person shall be fined not more than five hundred ($500.00) 
dollars and costs for each offense, and in default of payment thereof may be imprisoned 
for not more than fifty (50) days. 
 
2. The fines imposed under this Section shall be in addition to any other relief granted to the 
City of a monetary nature under the provisions of this Article. 
 
3. Each and every day that the violation continues shall constitute a separate offense for 
which a fine can be imposed.

SECTION 506 – INSTALLMENT PAYMENT PLAN FOR ANY DEFICIENCY 
In the appropriate circumstances, the Treasurer will enter an installment payment plan and defer 
further collection action, if the taxpayer enters into a written agreement with the Treasurer. The 
Treasurer will approve installment payment plans only if such a plan is in the best interests of the 
City. The taxpayer must specifically request the installment payment plan from the Treasurer. For 
the required terms of any installment plan See, Second Class City Treasurer’s Sale and Collection 
Act, 53 P.S. § 27207 and Local Taxpayer Bill of Rights, 53 Pa.C.S. § 8436. If the taxpayer fails to 
abide by the terms of the installment payment plan, the Treasurer may demand immediate payment 
of tax, penalty and interest. 
 
 
ARTICLE VI 
TAXPAYER REMEDIES 
SECTION 601 – TREASURER’S HEARING 
Any taxpayer aggrieved by an assessment by the Treasurer shall, within ninety (90) days after the 
date of notice of the assessment, request a Treasurer’s Hearing on a form obtained from the 
Treasurer for that purpose. 53 Pa.C.S. § 8431. The Treasurer  may  on  his/her  own  initiative  
cite a taxpayer for a hearing. 
 
a. 
Any taxpayer who fails to request a Treasurer’s Hearing within a timely manner, waives 
the right to contest any element of the assessment, and that party’s failure to challenge 
the Treasurer’s adjudication will be construed as an admission by that party as to the 
propriety of the assessment. 
 
b. 
The written petition for reassessment shall contain at minimum: 
 
1. The taxpayer’s name, address, and daytime telephone number. 
2. The taxpayer’s account and/or social security number. 
3. A copy of the assessment notice the taxpayer received from the Finance Department. 
4. A detailed explanation consisting of the reason or reasons the taxpayer disagrees with 
the assessment and any documentation necessary to support the taxpayer’s claims.

SECTION 602 - APPEALS 
Any taxpayer aggrieved by the decision of the Treasurer, following a hearing, shall have the  
right to make an appeal to the Court of Common Pleas of Allegheny County, in accordance with 
the Taxpayers Bill of Rights. 53 Pa.C.S. § 8434. This  appeal must be commenced within   thirty 
(30) days of the date of the Treasurer’s decision. If no such appeal is timely filed, the aggrieved 
party waives his right to contest any element of the Treasurer’s adjudication, and that party’s 
failure to challenge the same will be construed as an admission by that party as to the propriety 
of the Treasurer’s decision. No hearing or appeal will operate to suspend the accrual of penalty 
and interest from the date the  tax was due to the date it is actually paid. 
SECTION 603 – PAYMENT UNDER PROTEST 
The Treasurer will accept payments of disputed tax amounts under protest pending appeals; 
however, any request for refund of such monies must be filed in accordance with Section 604. 
SECTION 604 - REFUNDS 
a. 
A taxpayer who has overpaid the Local Services Tax, or who is not liable for the Local 
Services Tax, may file a written request with the Department of Finance for a refund or a 
credit of the tax. A request for refund or a credit shall be made within three (3) years of 
the due date for filing the return or one (1) year after actual payment of the tax, whichever 
is later. If no return is required, the request shall be made within three (3) years after the 
due date for payment of the tax or within one (1) year after actual payment of the tax, 
whichever is later. All refunds shall be processed consistently with Section 2 of the Local 
Tax Enabling Act, 53 P.S. § 6924.301.1(f)(9)(vii) and the Local Taxpayer Bill of Rights, 53 
Pa.C.S § 8426. 
b. 
For amounts paid as a result of a notice assessing or informing a taxpayer of an 
underpayment, a written request for a refund shall be filed with the Department  of 
Finance within one (1) year of the date of the payment. 
c. 
Refunds made within seventy-five (75) days of a refund request or seventy-five (75) days 
after the last day the employer is required to remit the local services tax for the last 
quarter of the calendar year, whichever is later, shall not be subject to interest. 
d. 
In general, refunds will not be issued to employers unless the employer provides proof that 
the overpayment has been refunded to the person from whom the tax was originally 
withheld. If the employer can demonstrate that it made a computation error on the return 
and show that the underlying tax was not withheld from any person, the refund can be 
issued to the employer.

SECTION 605 – SAVINGS CLAUSE AND SEVERABILITY 
If a final decision of a court of competent jurisdiction holds any provision of these regulations, or 
the application of any provision to any circumstances, to be illegal or unconstitutional, the other 
provisions in these regulations, or the application of such provision to other circumstances, shall 
remain in full force and effect. The intent of the Treasurer is that the provisions of these 
regulations shall be severable and that they would have been adopted if any such illegal or 
unconstitutional provisions had not been included herein.
