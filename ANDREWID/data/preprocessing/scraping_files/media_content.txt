Pittsburgh’s award-winning food is a huge draw for visitors, and it is continually getting recognized in national and international media. In 2019,

BBC Good Food

named Pittsburgh one of the top-10 destinations for foodies – the only U.S. city to make the list.

Pittsburgh is a city built on innovation, and that certainly doesn’t stop with the food thanks to Pittsburgh’s chef-driven fare. In fact, the city is home to more than a dozen James Beard Award semifinalists, most recently Nik Forsberg of

fet-fisk

, a multi-faceted pop-up project recently turned full-service restaurant; Kate Lasky and Tomasz Skowronski of

Apteka

in Bloomfield; and Wei Zhu of

Chengdu Gourmet

in Squirrel Hill.

fet-fisk was also recognized as one of the best restaurants in America by the

New York Times

in 2024.

New restaurants and concepts play a large role in Pittsburgh’s hot culinary renaissance. From

Ritual House

(Downtown) to

Carmi’s Soul Food

(Mexican War Streets),

Brothmonger

(Bloomfield),

Novo Asian Food Hall

(Strip District) and many others – there are plenty of options sure to satisfy any hungry appetite.

Consider these tasty news morsels. Yelp users voted traditional middle eastern bakery

Pitaland

one of the

top-100 restaurants in the U.S. in 2023

; upscale sushi and gin bar

gi-jin

ranked in

will take visitors back more than 150 years to Pittsburgh’s oldest bar and restaurant. Located in Market Square Downtown, the unique tavern has been designated a historic landmark by the Pittsburgh History and Landmarks Foundation.

While Pittsburgh’s appetite for traditional culinary staples – such as pierogies, kielbasa and cabbage rolls introduced by European immigrants or french fry- and coleslaw-garnished

Primanti Bros.

sandwiches – is still going strong, the food scene in this city of three rivers has exploded, much like the city itself.

There are now more than 100 restaurants in the Downtown Pittsburgh area and many more in the city’s 90 unique and diverse neighborhoods. In addition to the many restaurant options, visitors will also find numerous annual food festivals across the city throughout the year, including

Pittsburgh: A City Transformed

Pittsburgh, a city synonymous with resilience and reinvention, has undergone some of the most significant economic and environmental transformations of any American city.

Once known as “The Steel City” and “The City That Built America,” Pittsburgh was a dominant force in the nation’s industrial development. At the height of steel production, Pittsburgh was responsible for more than 60% of the total output in the U.S., contributing to the construction of critical infrastructure like skyscrapers, bridges and military equipment. This industrial prowess created wealth and prominence but also impacted the environment and quality of life.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Environmental Transformation: Turning the Tide

By the 1940s, the environmental degradation had reached a tipping point. Local leaders, both public and private, recognized the urgency of revitalizing the city. They began a multi-decade effort to clean up Pittsburgh’s air and water while reinvigorating Downtown to make it an attractive place for investment, innovation and workers. This hard-won transformation laid the foundation for the Pittsburgh we know today—a celebrated hub for climate resilience and innovation.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

From Industrial Powerhouse to Innovation Hub

While the city’s industrial economy dominated for much of the 20th century, Pittsburgh has since transitioned to focus on cutting-edge research and innovation. Investments in sectors such as robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), clean energy, medicine and education transformed Pittsburgh into a diversified, knowledge-driven economy. The region is now a global leader in emerging industries such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, AI, decarbonization, and biotechnology.

Pittsburgh is home to some of the brightest minds in the world, particularly from its prestigious universities: Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Pittsburgh, along with over 70 regional universities and colleges. This educational ecosystem fosters a culture of creativity and ingenuity, making Pittsburgh a testing ground for world-shaping technologies in fields ranging from robotics to clean energy. In fact, the region’s emphasis on decarbonization is helping shape the global transition to clean energy, pioneering the next wave of environmental sustainability with innovations like fuel cells, battery technology and hybrid microgrids. Other notable innovations originating from Pittsburgh include the first polio vaccine, treatments for blindness, autonomous vehicle technology and more.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Today: Contrasts Create Opportunities for the Future

While the city is proud to have earned a reputation as a technological powerhouse, Pittsburgh is a city defined by contrasts, rich in culture and community. The grit of its steel industry past intersects with the brilliance of its technological future. Traditional Pittsburgh foods, like pierogies, sit alongside world-class international cuisine. The city’s historic landmarks and architecture are set against cutting-edge advancements in energy, biotechnology and robotics. These contrasts unite Pittsburgh’s 90 distinct neighborhoods, diverse industries, and a global community of people who come together to push the city forward.

The City of Champions’ mentality shines not only through its globally beloved professional sports teams, but also through the sportsmanship-like spirit demonstrated across every facet of the city, known as the “Pittsburgh Way.” Over the years, Pittsburghers have consistently come together across industries and sectors—business, government, academia and philanthropy—to solve complex challenges. This collaborative and welcoming ethos has fueled the city’s success and played a key role in both its economic recovery and its ongoing transformation.

Beyond tech and sports, Pittsburgh has established itself as a haven for arts and culture, with world-class institutions like the Andy Warhol Museum, Carnegie Museums, Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra and Pittsburgh Opera, along with a vibrant Cultural District.

The city’s culinary scene is also thriving. Its diverse mix of local favorites, fine dining, fine dining and more than a dozen James Beard semi-finalists ensures plenty of tastebud-enticing options for every palate.

Pittsburgh’s journey of transformation—where steel bridges symbolize unity, and where historic rivers converge—is one of resilience and progress. It’s on the brink of a boisterous movement, recently recognized as a

2025 must-see destination

by Lonely Planet and announced as the

2026 NFL Draft host city

.

In 2023, VisitPITTSBURGH launched the city’s first ever

10-Year Tourism Development Plan

to serve as a roadmap for the development of leisure, business and sports travel in both the City of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County. The state of Downtown – and plans for its future – play a fundamental role in bringing these strategies for new experiences, enhanced connectivity and industry development to life. The energy and excitement surrounding Downtown is palpable – and much of it is related to development projects happening all over the city.

Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro announced a

$600 million public-private plan

to revitalize Downtown. This effort is expected to help catapult Pittsburgh’s economic and societal evolution. As part of this investment, Pittsburgh will become home to a new luxury hotel, Hotel Bardo. Anticipated to debut in 2026, LEFT LANE is bringing the Bardo brand to Pittsburgh through the conversion and transforming the historic, 40-story Gulf Tower into a luxury, mixed-use urban development offering 130 guestrooms and suites; 220 residences; 3 restaurants and bars; and 10,000 square feet of amenity space. The new development opens the door for not only new inventory – but a new market for luxury travel – that remains untapped by the city.

The

Esplanade project

aims to revitalize nearly 15 acres of post-industrial sites in Pittsburgh’s North Shore, creating a vibrant waterfront community with new residential units, public spaces, parks, shops and restaurants along the Ohio River. Upon completion, the project will include over 1.7 million square feet of space—sustainably designed—to connect the community and enhance experiences for visitors.

The Carnegie Science Center is also in the early stages of plans for a major

$90 million expansion

and renovation to its North Shore campus. While plans are still conceptual, the CSC has ample space to work with, including 12 acres next to Acrisure Stadium. The plans are anticipated to include potential changes to the riverfront to improve environmental conditions and expansion of the CSC footprint.

The University of Pittsburgh is nearing the completion of its

Victory Heights project

. The new state-of-the-art arena and sports complex that will boost the trajectory of Pitt student athletes and for the region. The project will provide an unrivaled competition space, demonstrate the University’s commitment to a culture of comprehensive excellence and elevate facilities in a competitive way to contend in recruiting the nation's most talented student athletes and coaches.

Similarly, Point Park University

unveiled results

from its recently commissioned Urban Land Institute study, which includes four major verticals of development exploration: reimagining Boulevard of the Allies; building a Downtown community events center; increasing the amount of affordable housing on and around campus; and creating a cultural corridor between Point Park University & the Cultural District. These prospective developments could change the landscape for the next generation of talent—and open doors to new facilities for business and sports events.

As Pittsburgh continues to make its mark on the global stage, it remains a place where tradition meets transformation, and where the possibilities are limitless.

Pittsburgh: A Sports Destination

Fans dress head-to-toe in black and gold. Chants echo off the skyscrapers. Victory fireworks light up the city skyline. Passionate fanbases, winning teams and beautiful stadiums are all huge reasons Wallet Hub has recognized Pittsburgh as one of the top sports cities year after year.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Fans dress head-to-toe in black and gold. Chants echo off the skyscrapers. Victory fireworks light up the city skyline. Passionate fanbases, winning teams and beautiful stadiums are all huge reasons Wallet Hub has recognized Pittsburgh as one of the

top sports cities

year after year.

Aptly named the City of Champions, Pittsburgh is home to three widely-known professional sports teams – the Steelers, Penguins and Pirates – each with its own dynamic history of world championships, incredible moments and hall of fame players.

The

Pittsburgh Steelers

, named after the city’s blue-collar heritage, are among the most decorated teams in the National Football League and the first to have won six Super Bowls. Fans can be seen descending to the North Shore to attend games at

Acrisure Stadium

(capacity 68,400) and waving the

Terrible Towel

to cheer their team to another winning season.

In 2026, Pittsburgh is set to take on its latest momentous chapter in NFL history by hosting hundreds of thousands of fans for the

2026 NFL Draft

. The 3-day event will also be broadcasted to more than 50 million viewers worldwide, showcasing a city of resilience, reinvention and unity—where the journey to legend begins.

With back-to-back Stanley Cup-winning seasons in 2016 and 2017, the

Pittsburgh Penguins

are one of the hottest tickets on ice. The Penguins, who play at

PPG Paints Arena

, are coming off a record-setting run in the NHL with a league-best 16 consecutive trips to the postseason, winning three championships within that span. The Penguins own five total Stanley Cups.

Spring means the return of the

Pittsburgh Pirates

, more commonly referred to as the “Bucs” or “Buccos,” and baseball to the city. Fans enjoy the old ballgame at

PNC Park

, a fantastic mix of classic ballpark aesthetics and modern comforts with an unmatched skyline view, consistently named one of the best ballparks in America. The Pirates own a stacked trophy case of their own, with five World Series championships won from 1909-1979.

Even the city’s college teams are championship-caliber. The

University of Pittsburgh Panthers

can be seen playing at Acrisure Stadium for football and the

Petersen Events Center

for basketball. Together, these Pitt teams have won 11 National Championships.

Robert Morris University

(home to the only Division I ice hockey teams in the city) and

Duquesne University

round out the region’s NCAA Division I schools. Also located in the city are the college athletics teams of

Carlow

,

Carnegie Mellon

,

Chatham

and

Point Park

universities, as well as

La Roche College

and the

Community College of Allegheny County

.

At

Highmark Stadium

, which includes a spectacular view of the city, the

Pittsburgh Riverhounds SC

take the pitch for the United Soccer League. And in 2025, Pittsburgh welcomes its first USL W League team, the

Pittsburgh Riveters SC

.

The Hounds and Riveters also share the stadium with the

Pittsburgh Passion

, the national championship-winning women’s full-contact football team, and the

Pittsburgh Thunderbirds

, a professional Ultimate Frisbee (Disc) organization in the American Ultimate Disc League.

The

Pittsburgh Knights

game-on in the digital world as Pittsburgh’s global esports franchise. The team has partnered with the Steelers, the Penguins’ great Evgeni Malkin and Pittsburgh-native, multi-platinum recording artist Wiz Khalifa to become a premiere team to watch in the scene.

The history of Pittsburgh sports teams’ winning ways is showcased at must-see museums and monuments.

The Clemente Museum

is dedicated to the life and career of the former Pittsburgh Pirates baseball player, Roberto Clemente, while the

Western Pennsylvania Sports Museum

(a museum within a museum located inside the

Heinz History Center

) brings the city’s top sports moments to life with a stunning collection of artifacts and interactive displays. Steelers Nation can take a trip through the franchise’s history at the recently opened

Hall of Honor Museum

inside Acrisure Stadium. And, before leaving the North Shore, they can take the pilgrimage to

The Immaculate Reception Monument

, the site of one of the greatest plays in football history, which set the tone for the Steelers’ dominant 70s run of championships.

Here, the love of the game echoes from historic stadiums to the bustling streets of the Strip District. And while our black and gold pride may run deep, it’s paired with just as much Midwest friendliness that makes our city feel like home away from home—no matter who you’re rooting for.

Wrapped in rivers, intertwined with trails and packed with parks, Pittsburgh is full of outdoor adventure. Whether you prefer to bike, walk, rollerblade or simply gather with friends for a picnic, green getaways and outdoor adventures are aplenty in Pittsburgh. It’s no wonder WalletHub continuously ranks the city among the

best for an active lifestyle

.

One of the best ways to explore Pittsburgh is to take to the streets to experience its natural beauty, unique terrain and diverse offerings at every turn. Pittsburgh is incredibly walkable with more than 180 miles of trails throughout the nine

Allegheny County Parks

, 700+ public stairways and numerous

walkable bridges

.

Plus, Pittsburgh has become known as a city that supports and encourages bicycling, with bike-accessible

hotels

and public transportation, an

easy-to-use bikeshare system

and a devoted community of cyclists. In fact, People for Bikes, one of the nation’s leading organizations dedicated to making bicycling safer, more convenient and appealing for everyone, recognizes Pittsburgh among the best places to bike in the world.

Pittsburgh’s unique topographical blend of steep, winding hills and flat river areas makes it one of the best cities for cycling enthusiasts. There are miles and miles of riverfront trails in the Pittsburgh area and dedicated bike lanes throughout the city’s neighborhoods.

Some of Pittsburgh’s most famous guided tours allow visitors to explore the city’s 90 unique neighborhoods by foot or bike, like

Bike the Burgh

and

‘Burgh Bits & Bites Food Tour

. There are plenty of self-guided options as well, including

Downtown walking tours

,

gallery crawls

and even a

Green Building Walking Tour

.

Perhaps the most famous trail is the

Great Allegheny Passage

– locally known as the GAP trail – a 150-mile, non-motorized path that connects Pittsburgh to the C&O Canal Towpath in Cumberland, Maryland, creating a 355-mile continuous experience to Washington, D.C. For those not ready to tackle the entire path, consider renting a bicycle from

Golden Triangle Bike

and enjoying a leisurely ride along the Monongahela River.

Looking to stay more local? Explore the

Three Rivers Heritage Trail System

, which links together city neighborhoods and highlights Pittsburgh’s natural beauty and history while following the flowing lines of the city’s rivers and parks. Several

suburban trails

also will excite hiking and walking enthusiasts. The area’s extensive network of trails extends outward to the suburbs, offering a multitude of cycling opportunities in locations such as

Hartwood Acres

and

Seven Springs Resort

. For those looking for a more pastoral experience, the

Youghiogheny River Trail

and

Laurel Highlands Hiking Trail

The City of Pittsburgh is also home to

176 parks

Point State Park

is full of beautiful trails for hiking, biking or running. There also is open green space for playing games or relaxing, a swimming pool in the summer months and an ice rink in the winter.

Frick Park

covers more than 600 acres of trails, wetlands and dog-friendly areas. Tucked into the neighborhood that shares its name,

Highland Park

hosts volleyball courts, a swimming pool and plenty of trails that make this park a hit with the family.

Throughout the parks and trails intertwined across the city, visitors will find an array of beautiful scenery, including more than 3,500 native Eastern redbud trees planted over the past five years by

The Pittsburgh Redbud Project

.

With more than 30 miles of river shoreline, it is only fitting that Pittsburgh is a premier location for recreational boating, fishing and a variety of other water sports. During the warmer months,

Venture Outdoors

offers kayak and paddleboard rentals to enjoy throughout North Park Lake, Sharpsburg’s James Sharp Landing and Downtown, regardless of experience level.

SurfSUP Adventures

Laurel Highlands

, Class III and IV rapids await thrill-seeking rafters along the Youghiogheny River at

Ohiopyle State Park

some of the best golf

in the United States. The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania boasts more than 500 public golf courses. Visitors can tee off at more than 50

public golf courses

Pittsburgh International Airport Transformed

Pittsburgh International Airport is the front door and first impression for millions of annual travelers to the Pittsburgh region. The airport’s Terminal Modernization Program – a $1.4 billion effort to transform the airport experience – is wrapping up this year, with the new terminal expected to open by the end of 2025.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pittsburgh International Airport is the front door and first impression for millions of annual travelers to the Pittsburgh region. The airport’s

Terminal Modernization Program

– a $1.4 billion effort to transform the airport experience – is wrapping up this year, with the new terminal expected to open by the end of 2025.

The new 700,000-square-foot terminal is the first in the United States to be designed and constructed for a post-pandemic world. Key design features, including large outdoor terraces and touchless processes, will allow for increased social distancing and access to the outdoors. The new terminal will consolidate and streamline operations including ticketing, baggage handling, security, ground transportation and concessions.

The region’s

commitment to sustainability

will be evident throughout construction and operation of the new terminal, with an aim to comply with LEED® Silver certification and an intent to reduce overall energy, emissions, water and waste across airport facilities by 2030.

When the Terminal Modernization Program is completed, visitors will experience new airport facilities that better reflect and serve the community, inspire the industry and advance the region’s role as a world leader in innovation.

Among planned enhancements are increasing the main security checkpoint area, reducing the time it takes to get from curbside to airside and increasing the area for concessions and retail. Plans also are in place to increase covered parking, reduce the time it takes to get from International Arrivals to curbside and construct a multi-modal transportation center complete with new rental car facilities and surface parking lots.

As Pittsburgh continues to strengthen its position on the world stage, the airport strives to better meet the needs of business and leisure travelers which are constantly evolving. The city is home to some of the best universities producing exceptional, impactful leaders in the technology, medical and robotic sectors. The airport modernization will deliver real opportunity to the region while also creating a lasting first impression for visitors and showcasing regional

arts and cultural amenities

.

Beyond the new terminal, airport leaders are improving facilities both on and around the airfield. In summer 2021, Pittsburgh International became the first airport in the world

completely powered by an independent microgrid

. Using nearly 10,000 solar panels and on-site natural gas, the first-of-its-kind microgrid increases resilience and maximizes public safety. The airport will remain connected to the traditional electrical grid as an option for emergency or backup power.

Named “Airport of the Year” by

Air Transport Magazine

in 2017, Pittsburgh International Airport is a two-time Travel + Leisure Top-10 Domestic Airport honoree (

2018

,

2019

) and most recently was named one of the “World’s Most Innovative Companies” by

Fast Company

in 2020.
