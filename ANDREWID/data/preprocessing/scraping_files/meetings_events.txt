Easy Travel

Easy Travel

Getting to Pittsburgh is easy, convenient and totally worth the trip!

Historically, Pittsburgh was known as the “Gateway to the West”. The convergence of the three rivers could take travelers the entire way to the Gulf of Mexico and was located on the tip of the frontier.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Today, we’re still a traveler’s city. Conveniently located within 500 miles of nearly half the U.S. population and less than a 90-minute flight from nearly half of North America's population, planning a trip to Pittsburgh is easier than you may think.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pittsburgh by Air

Pittsburgh International Airport

is a world-class facility that was ranked number one by

Condé Nast Traveler

and was named

Air Transport World Magazine

’s Airport of the Year in 2017. With its continued updates and innovative services such as a therapy pet program, PITT PAWS, for nervous flyers while they wait for their flight, or the USO Pittsburgh Airport Center Volunteer Program for travel weary veterans, the Pittsburgh International Airport is ever-evolving to better serve all travelers.

Notable features:

Presley’s Place, one of the first airport sensory rooms in the world and a safe and calming space for children and adults alike

Free, high-speed wireless internet service throughout all four airside terminals

AirMall, a shopping and dining experience complete with local favorites like Penn Brewery and Primanti Brothers

Kidsport, the first airport-based play area for children

A Mother's Nursing Lounge

Continued Innovation

Plans to transform

the world-class facility are in the works. In 2023, the new Pittsburgh International Airport will be operational, featuring a more efficient, improved passenger experience, facilities designed for the future and a atmosphere that is distinctly Pittsburgh.

A new, 635,000 square-foot-terminal facility will include airport operations, consolidated airline operations, as well as all passenger and public spaces. New parking and transportation infrastructure will include a new roadway system that will support the new terminal building, as well as a multi-level parking garage and a dedicated ground transportation center.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Airport Transportation

Only 25 minutes from Downtown Pittsburgh, there are several transportation options to get into the city from the airport. Quick and easy rides with

Uber

,

Lyft

and

zTrip

can be hailed outside Baggage Claim Door #4.

The cheapest and most efficient airport transportation is the

Pittsburgh Port Authority's 28X Airport Flyer.

A port authority bus runs pickups from the airport to the city twice an hour, and only costs $2.75. A ticket vending machine for tickets is available at Lower-Level Baggage Claim, near Door #2.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pittsburgh by Car

Flying isn't the only way to get to Pittsburgh. Driving is a convenient option for many. Attendees from 10 states, Washington, D.C., and parts of Canada can drive to Pittsburgh in fewer than six hours. If driving through the Fort Pitt Tunnel, you will experience why Pittsburgh is said to be the only “city with an entrance,” as the stunning skyline appears into view.

Once here, apps like

ParkPGH

and

Go Mobile PGH

make it easier to get real-time parking availability and rates and allow you to fill the meter without ever having to leave. Download one of these apps to find up-to-the-minute real-time availability on parking in town.
