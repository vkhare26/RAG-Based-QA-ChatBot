Discover and explore Pittsburgh's unique drinking history!

In 1794, the Whiskey Rebellion was in full force because of farmers rebelling against the whisky task which in return made western Pennsylvania a hub for a lot of distilleries during that time. This changed when prohibition came into effect where it made it illegal to produce and sell alcohol.

Fast forward to the year 2000, when the whole state of Pennsylvania had only one distillery. Today, there are around 70 in the state with more than a dozen of those located in Allegheny County. Follow this handy map on where to find Pittsburgh spirits, pre-mixed cocktails, wine, cider, mead and more!

Pittsburgh food has always been rooted in tradition and fresh off the farm. As a result, farmers' markets are a well established part of Pittsburgh culture. There are more farmers' markets and community gardens per capita in Pittsburgh than in most U.S. metropolitan areas. In season, you can find one just about every day of the week in different neighborhoods. Whether it's a church parking lot, a sidewalk stand, or a tent off the side of the road, these markets sell local farm fresh produce, eggs, cheese, homemade baked goods, jams and honey. Some farmers' markets even sell Amish-made wood furniture and rugs. For a complete list of Pittsburgh area farmers' markets,
