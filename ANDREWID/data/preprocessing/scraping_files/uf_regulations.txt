artist management companies, and other related positions.

whether in cash or in property.  This does not include wages or

implied, oral or written, whether lawfully or unlawfully employed.

corporations and unincorporated associations shall mean the officers 
thereof.

business entity, who engages with a Publicly Funded Facility regarding the 
organization, marketing, or offering for sale of tickets to an event. 
PUBLICLY FUNDED FACILITY— any sports stadium or arena in the City 
which has been constructed or maintained, in whole or in part, through the 
use of public funds. Publicly Funded Facilities include: 1001 -1035 5TH

§ 201.  LEVY AND RATE. 
 
A fee for general revenue purposes of three (3) percent  of Earned Income 
is hereby imposed on each Nonresident who uses a Publicly Funded 
Facility to engage in athletic event or otherwise render a performance for 
which a Nonresident receives remuneration.   
 
§ 202.  ALLOCATION OF EARNED INCOME. 
 
 
 
 
(a)     Members of professional athletic teams, other than professional 
football teams calculate a “total games played within the City of Pittsburgh” 
versus “total games played (including exhibition, preseason, regular season 
and post-season games)” fraction. Multiply that fraction against the player’s 
total compensation. In determining “games played” include exhibition 
games that are officially sanctioned by the team’s league office in both the 
numerator and denominator of this fraction. 
Earned Income x (Total games played in PGH/Total games played) x .03 
(b)     Members of professional football teams calculate a “total duty days 
within the City of Pittsburgh” versus “total duty days” fraction. Multiply that 
fraction against the player’s total compensation. In determining “duty days”, 
include preseason and regular season practice sessions; pre-season and 
regular season games; and post-season games and practice sessions that 
are officially sanctioned by the team’s league office in both the numerator 
and denominator of this fraction. 
Earned Income x (Total duty days in PGH/Total duty days) x .03 

 
6 
 
(c)    Non-Player Personnel are apportioned on the basis of working days 
per year. These include team employees, such as coaches, trainers and 
any other persons required to travel with the team and perform services on 
behalf of the team; game officials. Divide the total number of working days 
within the city of Pittsburgh by the total number of working days in the year 
to arrive at the working days apportionment fraction.  
Earned Income x (Total work days in PGH/Total work days) x .03 
(d) Entertainers are apportioned based on earned income attributable for 
the performance in the city’s Publicly Funded Facility  
Earned Income for performance x .03 
 
(e) In general the taxpayer’s apportionable income for the City of Pittsburgh 
would correspond to the apportionable income reported to PA as earned in 
the City of Pittsburgh.

performance for which a Nonresident receives Earned Income, is required 
to withhold and remit to the Treasurer the usage fee.  In the event the

Qualified Managing Entity and Contracting Parties subject to the 
requirements of these Regulations are required to keep such records as 
will enable the filing of true and accurate returns of the Usage Fee, and 
such records shall be preserved for a period of not less than three (3) years 
from the filing date or due date, whichever is later, in order to enable the 
Treasurer to verify the correctness of those declarations or returns. 
 
§ 403.  EXAMINATION OF RECORDS. 
 
 (a) The Treasurer and agents designated by him or her are hereby 
authorized to examine the books, papers, and records of any 
supposed Qualified Managing Entity or Nonresident Contracting 
Party, or of any user or supposed user, in order to verify the accuracy 
of any declaration or return, or if no declaration or return was filed, to 
ascertain the fee due.  Every Person is directed and required to give 
the Treasurer and/or his or her designees the means, facilities, and 
opportunity for such examinations and investigations as are hereby 
authorized.   
 

 
11 
 
(b) 
If records are not available to the City to support the returns which 
were filed or should have been filed, the Qualified Managing Entity or

available to the Treasurer either by producing them in a City location 
or by paying for the expenses incurred by the Treasurer in traveling to 
the place where the records are regularly kept.

and an amount is found to be due, the amount may be billed and collected 
with or without the formality of obtaining a return.  Notices of deficiency (i.e., 
where the return has been filed, but found to be deficient) shall include 
deficiencies for up to three(3) years prior to the date when the notice is 
issued.  Where no return was filed, there shall be no limit to the period of 
notification of deficiency. 
 
ARTICLE 5: VIOLATIONS 
 
§ 501.  NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. 
 
The remedies provided in this Article are not mutually exclusive.  The 
utilization by the Treasurer of one or more remedies does not preclude the 
utilization of another.  Moreover, use of the aforementioned remedies does 
not preclude the City’s use of any other legal or administrative procedure 
which can bring about compliance with the provision of the Code and these 
Regulations. 
 
§ 502.  PENALTIES. 
 

 
12 
 
(a)

rate of one (1) percent per month on the amount of the usage fee will 
be added, during the time the usage fee goes unpaid but the amount 
shall not exceed fifteen percent (15%) in the aggregate.   
 
(b) 
On any additional usage fee determined to be due as a result of a 
deficiency notice, penalty will be assessed from the day the usage 
fee should have been paid to the date of payment.  Penalty is 
calculated as described above in Section 502(a).   
 
(c) 
Where suit is brought for the recovery of the usage fee, the Person 
liable therefore shall, in addition, be liable for the costs of collection 
and the penalties herein imposed.    A Person’s belief that no usage 
fee is due and owing, or the failure of any such Person to receive or 
obtain the forms required for making the returns required by the Code 
is not a valid defense to the imposition of penalties for violation  
herein.  Good faith shall not be a defense to the imposition of penalty.

ARTICLE 6: SAVINGS 
 
§ 601.  SAVINGS CLAUSE AND SEVERABILITY.

provisions of these Regulations, or the application of any provision to 
any circumstances, to be illegal or unconstitutional, the other 
provisions in these regulations, or the application of such provision to

severable and that they would have been adopted if any such illegal 
or unconstitutional provisions had not been included herein. 
 
(b)   Should a court of competent jurisdiction determine this provision to be 
invalid for any reason, Persons subject to the Usage Fee shall not be 
exempt from any previously applicable earned income tax.
