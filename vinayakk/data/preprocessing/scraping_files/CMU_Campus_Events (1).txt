location: Multiple Locations (Choose location in confirmation email)
description: How does immigration shape identity in tech? Join Illah Nourbakhsh as he discusses Turn Left, his memoir on innovation and belonging.

Illah Nourbakhsh has spent fifty years navigating the space between cultures in conflict, enduring adversity, becoming resilient and successful, and yet, still failing to satisfy the question: "Where do I belong?" As it turns out, the answer lies in the space between categories.

Drawing from his experience as an Iranian-born immigrant, Nourbakhsh shares his journey from the Iranian Revolution to the AI revolution, electric car races to the dot-com boom, and National Geographic to NASA. Turn Left opens up the essential conversation of identity, community engagement, and the power of robotics.

Books will be available for purchase starting March 1st here. If you bring a copy of Turn Left, Illah will be signing books after the discussion. Plus, the first 10 people to sign up will receive a free signed copy!

Illah R. Nourbakhsh is Professor of Robotics at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, where he has taught for twenty-eight years. He is vice president of the school board for Winchester Thurston School and on the board of directors of the Southwestern Pennsylvania Environmental Health Project. He is also a trustee of the Benedum Foundation, which provides funding for local health, education, and small business development.

Currently, Nourbakhsh is honored as a Kavli Fellow of the National Academy of Sciences, a Hastings Fellow, and an inductee of the June Harless West Virginia Hall of Fame. Whether with NASA, the Jet Propulsion labs, or otherwise, Illah's research centers on ethics and technology, engaging with communities around the world to co-invent technologies that provide power and agency to marginalized populations that have a right to shape their own destiny.

He has also authored Robot Futures, AI and Humanity, and Introduction to Autonomous Mobile Robots.
