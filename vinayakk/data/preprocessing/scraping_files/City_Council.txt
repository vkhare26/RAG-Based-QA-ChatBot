What is a City Clerk?

A City Clerk serves two main functions for their community by...


- Providing a direct link between citizens and their government
- Serving as an historian for the entire recorded history of city and its people
Every municipality in the United States has a City Clerk or someone who functions as one. The official functions and duties of the City Clerk are outlined further in the City Clerk Functions section of this web site. In this section, we hope to provide you with a more general view of the City Clerk's role, and the background and history of this office.
The eminent political scientist, Professor William Bennett Munro, writing in one of the first textbooks on municipal administration (1934), stated:

Kimberly Clark-Baskin, CMC, City Clerk

Kimberly was born and raised in the Homewood neighborhood of the City and is the youngest of three children--and the only girl. She attended Pittsburgh Public Schools, graduating from George Westinghouse High School in 1993. She went on to earn her Bachelor’s Degree in Sociology w/ a Minor in Psychology and a concentration in Criminal Justice from Carlow University. Kimberly began her career with the City Clerk’s Office in 1994 as a paid intern, under then City Clerk, Linda Johnson-Wasler. During her college semester breaks, Kimberly worked in the City Clerk’s Office on an array of assignments from different Members of Council, and would also do research as needed per requests from the constituency of the City.
Over the years, Kimberly would be promoted to different positions within the Clerk’s Office, including, Administrative Assistant, Clerk 1, Clerk 2, Secretary and Supervisor. And, in September 2014, Kim was appointed as Deputy/Assistant City Clerk and worked in that capacity until her appointment as the City Clerk in October 2022. She attained her Certified Municipal Clerk (CMC) designation in July 2019 and is now working on her Master Municipal Clerk (MMC) designation. Kimberly has maintained a positive working relationship with the Clerk staff; City Council members and their staff; five different Mayoral administrations; and several outside entities. She prides herself on always remaining the same while working in the world of politics.
Kim lives in Homewood with her husband, Rasheed, their children Aniya, Samir, Rasheed and Ta’Laya, and her father, Kenneth. Kim is the proud grandmother of grandson Daryn and granddaughter Nyrah. Those who know Kimberly best know she is very family-oriented and continuously looks forward to each new day that she is blessed to share with them.
Kimberly credits Linda Johnson-Wasler with, not only introducing her to local politics, but also teaching her most of what she knows about the City Clerk’s Office and City Council. She also gives credit to and acknowledges Brenda Pree, her predecessor, with mentoring and teaching her during this journey. She thanks Linda and Brenda for being two extremely important women in her professional and personal life.

Home Rule Charter


What is Home Rule?

With home rule, Pittsburgh will no longer have to go to the State Legislature in Harrisburg to seek permission for actions it should be able to decide on its own. In the future, home rule will allow the City to do everything not expressly forbidden by state law or the Constitution. Moreover, the new charter will establish a more flexible, efficient and responsible government.
There are certain matters that the Study Commission was not allowed to change. The state law authorizing the Commission forbids any changes in pensions, benefits or working conditions now enjoyed by city employees, subjects of taxation, property assessments, eminent domain, public schools, or election laws. Therefore, this charter can only do part of the task of modernizing city government. Many other needed changes will have to come through the General Assembly of the Commonwealth.
Many essential changes, however, are made in this new charter. Particularly, it provides for a flexible, easy-to-change structure, and for improved access and response for citizens.

Business Processes

The City Clerk’s Office documents seven primary business processes:


- Meeting Notices
- Legislative Meeting Minutes
- Publication of Weekly Minutes
- Indexing and Publication of Annual Municipal Record Book
- Standing Committees Meeting Minutes
- Public Hearing Minutes
- Legislative Process (Ordinances and Resolutions)

Minutes

The City Clerk's Office is responsible for recording minutes for Legislative and Standing Committee Meetings, as well as Public Hearings. Each of these sessions is recorded by an on-site Stenographer. Minutes are also recorded verbatim and transcribed for publication. These minutes are kept on file in the City Clerk's office and copies are made available upon request. The minutes are also kept in a common computer drive as "read-only' documents for electronic researching purposes.
Obtain minutes for any Council meeting session, or call the Clerk’s Office and request a copy of the minutes you want. A 25 cent fee will be applied to all requested hard copies.

Production of Weekly Minutes And Production of Annual Municipal Record Books

For the purpose of continuity, and because of their interdependency, these processes are combined. The minutes of the Legislative Meetings of Council are published in separate weekly minute books. Each Member of Council receives a copy of these minutes, which are approved at the next Legislative Meeting of Council. Additional copies of these books are on file in the City Clerk's Office for public reference and distribution.
These weekly minute books are then used to compile an index for the publication of the Annual Municipal Record book. This book is divided into two parts. The first part is called The Minutes of the Proceedings, which contains, verbatim, all dialogue from Council's Legislative Meetings. This dialogue is indexed by various categories for reference at the beginning of the book. The second part is called Ordinances and Resolutions, which contains all legislation passed in Council for that respective year.

Overview

The Council of the City of Pittsburgh, being elected by district, must every ten (10) years apportion the districts so that each contains approximately the same number of persons pursuant to the United States 2020 Census. The criterion of equal size of elected representatives districts is generally understood to be a logical consequence of the Constitutional provision of one person, one vote, a principal derived from the equal protection clause of the Constitution of the United States.
Pittsburgh’s City Council reapportionment process in is governed by the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania’s Constitution, as set forth as follows.
The Pennsylvania State Legislature sets forth the statutory requirements the Council must adhere to at 53 Pa.C.S.A. 901 et seq. The four essential elements of reapportionment are as follows:
Additional commentary on the reapportionment process is noted in Pennsylvania’s Department of Community and Economic Development’s City Government in Pennsylvania Handbook as follows:
