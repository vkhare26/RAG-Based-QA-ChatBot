About City Planning

The Department of City Planning works with partners to plan and deliver a vision for the City’s future grounded in a Just Transition
We work to create and maintain an orderly, timely, environmentally-sustainable, and consistent approach to land use and development within the City. To achieve this end, Planning works with communities, civic organizations and public entities to develop long-term plans to sustain and revitalize a thriving city of neighborhoods for the people who live, work, learn and visit here.
MissionThe Department of City Planning is a convener of residents, communities, civic organizations, commissions, and public entities, and works with these partners to plan and deliver a vision for the City’s future grounded in a Just Transition. The Department works at the intersection of climate change, racial justice, and social equity to ensure healthy, safe and vibrant neighborhoods for all residents.Because the built environment plays a vital role in the lives of Pittsburgh residents, City Planning incorporates policies and activities that promote sustainability, climate resilience, design justice, arts and culture, housing affordability and economic opportunity in the development and implementation of the City’s Comprehensive Plan, neighborhood plans, land use policies, zoning regulations, approval of development projects, and coordination of community development programs and partnerships.The Department is committed to focusing core planning activities to prioritize neighborhoods that have been harmed by past planning policies and practices which have contributed to existing racial and economic inequities throughout the city. This effort requires deeper engagement and additional resources in the development of plans and policies, working to remove barriers to the Department’s services, and by recognizing a more holistic set of metrics to advance the wellbeing of our diverse communities.The Department of City Planning recognizes the power of residents to transform their neighborhoods and calls on us to use that power to shape the future of Pittsburgh.Integrated Planning DivisionThe Integrated Planning division manages data, develops plans, and informs policies related to food access, vacant land, housing, mobility, and economic opportunity.The Integrated Planning division leads research, special initiatives, and cross-agency collaborations focused on integrating strategic policy areas that ensure holistic outcomes with a focus on communities who have been historically under-served and marginalized by planning in Pittsburgh. The division produces trends analyses and special “future of cities” reports and convenings for a citywide audience. Integrated Planning also partners with City’s innovation-centric departments and units to establish shared goals for innovation-focused partnerships and pilots.Public Realm DivisionThe Public Realm division proactively engages with and supports communities who face the steepest challenges in accessing civic design opportunities, historic preservation resources, and public art initiatives.The Public Realm division leads development and implementation of policies, programs, and partnerships that make visible in the City’s public realm the art, cultures, traditions, and histories of Pittsburgh’s diverse communities.

1.Overview


Learn more about City Planning's Boards, Commissions, and Panels

The Department of City Planning (DCP) facilitates a number of Boards, Commissions, Panels, and Development Activities Meetings (DAMs) which review zoning variances and elements of development, design, public art, and historic preservation.
For additional information on a Board, Commission, or Panel, such as appointed members or past meeting minutes, please choose from the above table of contents or navigate through sections at the bottom of this page.

2.Contextual Design Advisory Panel (CDAP)

CDAP meets every other Tuesday, alternating with Planning Commission
The Contextual Design Advisory Panel (CDAP) is comprised of eight members with expertise in the physical development of the City. The panel's mission is to promote quality of life in the City of Pittsburgh. CDAP achieves its mission through professional, voluntary design assistance to maximize the economic, civic, contextual, and aesthetic value of new development projects impacting the public realm. To fulfill this mission, CDAP advises the Department of City Planning by reviewing and providing design guidance on selected, higher profile projects throughout the City.
CDAP is an advisory panel, not a commission. Together with staff design review, the panel works to resolve design issues through professional peer critique before a Commission conducts its review. This frees the the Commission to focus on its responsibility of assuring that new developments are consistent with the overall planning objectives of the City. Some examples of these core considerations are:


- The extent to which each development proposal addresses successful design, public space enhancement, context sensitivity and sustainable urbanism.
- Ensuring that projects feature well designed buildings and landscapes that engage both users and the streetscape. Buildings should also make appropriate connections to adjacent sites and to the larger neighborhood.
- The use of sustainable building materials and designs which consider the longer-term impact and use of a single project.

CDAP's Role in City Planning Design Review Process

Design review is a collaborative process between City Planning and project's design team. Staff Design Review is the initial design review phase using information submitted by the applicant. City Planning staff develop a set of Urban Design Targets, which are tailored to the development proposal, the unique site conditions, and the neighborhood and context of the development. Staff work with the applicant to address the Urban Design Targets and to satisfy design-related zoning requirements.
During the initial Staff Design Review phase, City Planning staff will recommend projects for review by CDAP. CDAP review is voluntary, but highly recommended for some projects. The applicant will update the design to address the Urban Design Targets and incorporate the staff’s comments, in preparation for the CDAP meeting. At the meeting, the project representative presents and discusses the project, surrounding context, and design concepts. CDAP members ask questions and make recommendations to the project representative.

Projects Reviewed by CDAP

Projects that CDAP may review range from building additions to multi-parcel developments. Staff evaluates each project and its surrounding context and determines whether CDAP review would be beneficial. This determination will be made early in the review process. The criteria considered include the size of the project, complexity of the design context, and impact on the public realm. Generally, CDAP reviews:


- Project Development Plans
- Final Land Development Plans
- Projects undergoing Site Plan Review

CDAP Meeting Material

- Revisions to any items previously submitted for Design Review
- Site plan showing proposed project and surrounding context
- Landscape plan showing surrounding context and proposed planting list
- Building elevations showing surrounding context and proposed materials
- When applicable, building sections showing site context
- Perspective views and renderings showing project in surrounding context
- Perspective views and renderings showing pedestrian context and sidewalk-level views
- Items that address Staff Design Review comments and Urban Design Targets

Meeting Format

The most common format used for CDAP meetings follows the below outline. City Planning staff will introduce the Panel, provide a brief project introduction, and then refer to the project team for a presentation. The presentation should include a project outline and discuss context and design-related concepts and goals. The presentation should focus on design review and does not need to discuss Zoning or DOMI related reviews unless related to the overall design goals.


- Project introduction by City Planning staff (5 minutes)
- Project presentation by project representative (10-15 minutes)
- General Panel discussion (30-40 minutes)
After the CDAP meeting, City Planning staff sends a summary of the comments to the applicant. The applicant follows up with staff and responds to the comments by updating the design accordingly. City Planning staff will summarize the Design Review, including comments from CDAP and subsequent revisions, to convey design feedback and guidance to the Planning Commission, as the final approval determines.
In some situations, projects will be reviewed twice by CDAP. At the second meeting, the project representative presents changes since the last meeting and provides additional visuals on the project as the design has developed. The second meeting may not be necessary for projects that meet the design objectives in the first full CDAP meeting.

Workshops

In addition to the regularly scheduled CDAP meetings, CDAP also holds workshops. Less like a formal review, a workshop is a collaborative meeting. The project representative brings their project goals and current design to the panel members who provide design guidance. CDAP can help the project representative meet their objectives while helping to create successful urban spaces.
To contact CDAP via email, please email pacd@pittsburghpa.gov

Historic Preservation Program

Pittsburgh's cultural heritage is the City's legacy, formed by its people, place, neighborhoods, buildings, landscapes, objects, and stories -- everything that helped to shape Pittsburgh, literally and figuratively, from the beginning. Cultural and historic resources have a significant impact on Pittsburgh's character. They are valuable, non-replaceable assets that contribute to a unique and distinct sense of place.
City Planning's Historic Preservation work is guided by PreservePGH, the Pittsburgh Cultural Heritage Plan, completed in 2012. PreservePGH's vision statement:
In the 21st century, Pittsburgh's distinct character and culture will be preserved in ways that contribute to a high quality of life. The City will offer a balance of tradition and innovation, preservation and new construction, environmental sensitivity and continued use of resources. Pittsburgh's place in history will be admired and reflected for centuries to come - in the City's historic structures - in the waters of the three rivers - in the materials of modern buildings - in the hearts and minds of all Pittsburghers.

Neighborhood Planning

Neighborhood planners act as liaisons between City government and the community for most planning processes. Neighborhood planners participate in, and often coordinate, community plans. This group of planners acts as go-to people for explanations of zoning, development, transportation and other planning-related matters.
Whether you're an individual or a representative of a community organization, neighborhood planners are here to help.

Planning Education Series

This is a series of informational sessions coordinated by DCP to build up knowledge for the upcoming neighborhood plan process. Each session focuses on a different topic area. Most often, the series will be held in the neighborhood where there is a neighborhood planning process about to begin.

Registered Community Organizations (RCOs)

The registered community organizationprogram establishes a set of standards for community-based organizations. If the organization meets these standards, it can initiate a process where it follows the standards in this guide to create a neighborhood plan that may be adopted by the Planning Commission.

Public Engagement Guide

The public engagement guideoutlines a framework for how the City should conduct engagement efforts throughout the next phases of the comprehensive planning process and establishes guidelines for improving the approach to engagement more broadly. The guide was developed through a collaboration of residents, community organizations, and City Planning. It is designed to help increase engagement with the planning process.

Neighborhood Plan Guide

In collaboration with public agencies and community planning partners, City Planning has developed theNeighborhood Plan Guideto establish a framework for how to create high-quality and consistent neighborhood plans. This guide creates a standard for the development of neighborhood plans that can be adopted by the Planning Commission. The City of Pittsburgh will initiate these planning processes in most instances and will use this document to guide its work. Registered Community Organizations can also initiate the neighborhood planning process and work with public agencies to follow these standards and adopt a plan.

Public Engagement Guide

In the fall of 2018, Pittsburgh’s Department of City Planning invited the Pittsburgh community to participate in a Public Engagement Working Group, a group created to review and renew the approach to public participation in the City’s long-range planning process. The key focus of the group’s work was to contribute to the public engagement strategy for the City’s Comprehensive Plan initiative. Engagement is a key aspect of completing the Comprehensive Plan, which, in coordination with major planning initiatives, will shape policy and practice for the city’s sustainable growth to 2030 and beyond.
The Public Engagement Guide outlines a framework for how the City should conduct engagement efforts throughout planning processes and establishes guidelines for improving the approach to engagement more broadly. The guide was developed through a collaboration of residents, community organizations and City Planning. It is designed to help increase engagement with the planning process.

In creating the Public Engagement Working Group, the Department of City Planning focused efforts on inviting and selecting a diverse and broad range of experts in public engagement. Those invited include individuals representing local universities, city government, Pittsburgh Public Schools, faith-based, non-profit and community organizations. Invited individuals were also asked to fill out an “Open Call” application, which was live for approximately two weeks as well as advertised on the Office of Community Affairs Facebook and Twitter, on the City’s NextDoor account, on the Department of City Planning Facebook and Twitter, in every Carnegie Library within city limits, and at a number of coffee shops and museums around the Pittsburgh. Additionally, City Planning staff distributed information about the Public Engagement Working Group to the community groups they work with and asked them to share that information. When the application closed, the Department of City Planning received approximately 70 applicants, from which 29 individuals were selected based off the criteria listed below. During this process we pushed to not only have a diverse representation of city residents, with at least two individuals represented from each of the nine Council Districts, but to also have the following types of representation:


- Ethnic and racial background
- Residential location
- Age
- Gender
- Experience in public engagement

Comprehensive Planning Process

Pittsburgh is the second largest city in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. It has roughly 300,000 people living in 90 neighborhoods within its 58 square miles. Pittsburgh serves as the administrative seat of Allegheny County and is the principal city of the Pittsburgh Metropolitan Area, also known as Greater Pittsburgh.
Pittsburgh has a storied and well-documented history of growth and prosperity, decline and collapse, and eventual rebound. In the early 1800s, the city became known as the “Gateway to the West.” This nickname referenced Pittsburgh’s location at the confluence of three major waterways. The Allegheny River and Monongahela River converge at what is known as “The Point” to form the Ohio River. This intersection positioned Pittsburgh as a leader in the trade industry for products such as coal, steel, timber, glass, oil, iron and limestone. By 1911, Pittsburgh manufactured half of the nation’s steel and the industry dominated the local economy. Due to the amount of pollution given off by the steel factories the city had a new nickname - “The Smoky City." As the domestic steel industry collapsed, Pittsburgh was left to face widespread decline and population loss. However, over the past 30 years, Pittsburgh has been able to diversify its economy, focusing on the higher education, medical and life sciences, tourism, and technology sectors.
Before we look to the future, we need to acknowledge our past, from the legacy of heavy industry to the heavy-handed government policies that disrupted neighborhoods and displaced residents and contributed to the degradation of the region’s air, soil and water. Today, Pittsburgh is a city that is both prosperous and unequal. Current conditions note an increase in the homeless population, rents and house prices are increasing at a pace that threatens our status as an “affordable city” to live, and historically marginalized communities continue to see higher rates of poverty, environmental injustices, poor health outcomes, and unequal access to opportunity.
In over 200 years as a chartered city, Pittsburgh has never created an integrated comprehensive plan to guide its growth. The city’s comprehensive planning efforts up to now have been through a piecemeal approach that engaged residents city-wide on one or two topics at a time. Most plans have been completed at the neighborhood level, with each having its own distinct character, history, and culture. While important, this has resulted in a patchwork of plans, completed at different times, to various levels of detail. The lack of a comprehensive plan also leaves the neighborhood plans with no context to ground them. An integrated citywide comprehensive plan will ensure that future neighborhood plans have a consistent and shared vision for the future.

Climate Justice / Just Transition

The foundational approach to Pittsburgh’s citywide comprehensive plan must be adhere to climate justice and Just Transition principles.
The City seeks to address the root causes of climate change, while simultaneously addressing a range of racial, social, and environmental injustices. These systemic injustices continue to exist in all many aspects of life for Black, Indigenous, and other non-White communities throughout the city. Racist land use policies and practices at the federal, state and municipal levels of government that targeted Black residents in many US cities, including Pittsburgh, have left a legacy of spatial and economic segregation that has been passed on from generation to generation. This is not the only story of Black life in Pittsburgh. Despite the struggles Black residents endured they persevered. Pittsburgh’s Black residents inspired and influenced the city and the region through the creation of small businesses, cultural institutions and civic organizations. Black residents continue to reshape the city’s social and political structures to advance equal rights, equal justice and equal access for all Pittsburghers.
As Pittsburgh continues to transition from an economy driven by extraction to one that is regenerative and multi-sectoral, we have an opportunity to center the health, safety and success of all city residents and communities. Envisioning a city where all residents have access to clean air and water systems, means that Pittsburgh must develop sustainable land use practices, emphasize the use of renewable energy, and provide economic opportunities in all clean economy sectors. The City wants to ensure all Pittsburghers have access to the economy of the future in a place that embraces its rich diversity of cultures, traditions and abilities welcomes immigrants and refugees, and unlocks innovation that is needed for the city to thrive.
This comprehensive planning process should not only strive to address past land use failures but ensure every resident in every neighborhood sees themselves as part of the future prosperity of the city. For this reason, the process must recognize and consider how the interrelated cultural, social, environmental and economic factors have on land use and related policies proposed in the Plan.
For more information and to sign-up for future community engagement related to Pittsburgh's Comprehensive Plan process, please visit ourEngagePGH page.

History of the Comprehensive Plan


Riverbank Conditions Assessment and Best Practices Study

Concerned by the number of landslides happening throughout the city, Pittsburgh’s Department of City Planning partnered with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) Pittsburgh District to assess the conditions of riverbanks along the Allegheny, Monongahela, and Ohio Rivers. The partnership’s objectives were to assess and map the current condition of approximately 43 miles of riverbank and develop an applied best practices document to guide future remediation of unstable riverbanks.

About the Riverbank Stability Survey

The team first developed evaluation criteria based on observable characteristics of the Pittsburgh Pool’s riverbanks. Attributes included:


- Bank material and condition
- Slope
- The presence and type of vegetation
- Extent of impervious surfaces within the riparian area
- Presence and/or extent of existing features that could further contribute to bank instability (ex, existing erosion or undercutting, man made structures)
Once these criteria were established, the USACE spent several days sailing the rivers to visually assess the banks. The assessment was done on all banks within Pittsburgh City limits, and on some neighboring municipalities’ banks.
The USACE created an interactive map with the survey findings.
Mapping Tool
Other features included on the map are the route of the survey boat, photos of points along the riverbank, location of ALCOSAN culvert and outlet locations, bicycle trails, amount of impervious surface within 75 feet of the riverbank, and zoning categories.
They also created a decision tree structure to define and assign bank conditions scores to the various riverbank typologies.
Image Caption:Decision tree used to define and assign bank condition scores to naturalized riverbank typologies. Missing typologies and associated condition scores indicate typologies that were not encountered within the study area.
The final assessment results were based on material type, material condition, slope, observed typology, and riverbank condition.

About the Riverbank Best Practices Study

Once the team had categorized riverbank typologies, the USACE used the results to organize a Best Practices Guide, designed to assist with identifying the most effective riverbank stabilization and rehabilitation techniques for each riverbank typology. The Department of City Planning, Riverlife, and the USACE Pittsburgh District compiled pertinent existing reports and studies regarding Pittsburgh riverbank and riparian ecology, and best practices for riverbank rehabilitation and stabilization for urban riverbanks.
Riverbank stabilization approaches included in the report fall within the broad categories of bioengineering, erosion and sediment control, stormwater management, and geotechnical techniques.
After a description of the recommended approaches, the utilizes a series of tables to organize recommended stabilization techniques by final riverbank condition categories.

Broadway Avenue Public Realm Project

The City of Pittsburgh will redesign the Broadway Avenue streetscape in Beechview from Fallowfield Station to Wenzell Avenue. The project, which completed its planning phase in mid-late 2018 and is currently in the design phase for construction, is based on the 2011 SMART TRID study and is a result of engaging neighborhood residents, community groups, and stakeholders.
The scope of the project considers new elevated, ADA-accessible transit stops that include shelter from the elements, changes to the roadway, storm-water management infrastructure, and related streetscape improvements such as lighting, seating, and planting. Final improvements, design, and street configuration were determined through the community outreach process and input from the stakeholder group.
Broadway Avenue is a business district amidst revitalization by residents, the City, URA, property owners, and private developers. The neighborhood is well served by transit with a connection to downtown by the Port Authority’s Red Line. Many people arrive on Broadway by public transit but their trip does not begin or end at the T stop, it continues to their destination or residence.
This page will be updated as the work on this project progresses. In the meantime, please send comments to Mike Panzitta, Project Manager & Engineer for the Pittsburgh Department of Mobility & Infrastructure (Michael.panzitta@pittsburghpa.gov). You can also reach out to the Department of City Planning’s Neighborhood Planner for Beechview, Thomas Scharff, atthomas.scharff@pittsburghpa.gov.

Carrick Artistic Intersection

The Public Art and Civic Design Division of the Department of City Planning and the Department of Public Works sought out proposals to create a high quality artist designed intersection at Brownsville and Parkfield Roads, in Carrick. This project was initiated by Councilwoman Natalia Rudiak from District Four. As planning took place regarding traffic improvements for this intersection, Councilwoman Rudiakand her staff became interested in intersection enhancements such as an artist designed crosswalk or artist designed intersection markings.
On March 12, 2017, a community public meeting was organized by the office of Councilwoman Rudiak and facilitated by the Department of City Planning and the Department of Public Works. Community participants were asked to identify their interests in regard to the identity of Carrick,their interests in regard to design aesthetics for the artwork,their interest in place making for this area of Carrick, andtheir thoughts regarding safety for this intersection. Additionally, the community was engaged in a discussion around which type of implementation to pursue—ultimately the artist designed intersection was selected rather than artist designed crosswalks.
The selection panel chose artist Guy Ruff.

Hays Woods

The 626-acre undeveloped site in southeastern Pittsburgh, historically serving industrial purposes including coal mining, was purchased by the Urban Redevelopment Authority in 2016 and will be transferred to the City for park development. While the land is not pristine, having historically served industrial uses including coal mining, it has a sense of wilderness in an otherwise urban area. Despite the environmental degradation typical of old mined lands, it features areas of significant tree canopy, significant flora and fauna, and even a pair of nesting bald eagles. A series of trails crisscross the property, indicating its popularity among outdoor recreation enthusiasts. Because of these unique qualities, the City has decided to seize the opportunity to establish Hays Woods as a city park that will expand its value to patrons for generations to come while preserving and restoring important natural ecosystems.
In 2018, then Mayor William Peduto established the Hays Woods Task Force, led by Councilman Corey O’Connor and former Mayor Tom Murphy, to identify best land uses, opportunities and constraints for the area, and guiding principles for future site master planning. The Department of City Planning has been awarded a $100,000 grant from the Department of Conservation and Natural Resource Community Conservation Program, that will be matched by the City of Pittsburgh for a project total of $200,000. The grant will allow the master plan process to begin in 2020.
The Department of City Planning also received an abandoned mine land and drainage assessment grant through Trout Unlimited that will document issues related to former deep mining on the site and provide recommendations for remediation.

Pittsburgh’s Riverfront Zoning

In 2015, Pittsburgh began its multi-year riverfront rezoning project, doing outreach to inform a temporary zoning overlay district. The Riverfront Interim Planning Overlay District (RIPOD) was adopted in June of 2016. Immediately thereafter, the Department of City Planning began the process to draft permanent zoning for its riverfront areas.
Pittsburgh was changing rapidly. One-declining neighborhoods were experiencing a period of transformation, as existing properties were renovated and new housing was constructed at a renewed pace to accommodate increased demand for city-living. Businesses responded to the demand, with new restaurants, boutiques, and shops opening their doors in the City’s historic commercial districts. This change resulted in Pittsburgh being recognized as one of the top cities in the country to live, work, and play. The City was proud to be recognized for its strong neighborhood character its appealing mix of “grit and shine;’ that is, the gritty authenticity of a city that was built on hard work and heavy industry, and the more polished character of new development fueled by the growth of the City’s education, medical, and technology sectors.
Perhaps nowhere in the City does this interplay between “grit and shine” play out more visibly than along the City’s three rivers.The 35 miles of Ohio, Allegheny, and Monongahela Riverfront include parts of 19 different neighborhoods with distinct characters, economies, and topographies. Fueled by the City’s current zeitgeist, the demand for redevelopment along these 35 miles was (and is) high; new uses and users have been choosing to locate along Pittsburgh’s riverfront in close proximity to existing industrial businesses and residential neighborhoods.
The City’s previous industrial zoning did not adequately respond to the nature of the new mixed-use development and redevelopment occurring along the three rivers, in space that had once been used solely for industrial activities. Neither did it adequately protect the existing industrial entities that continued operations in the area and in many cases required river access to thrive. New regulations were needed to effectively balance new and existing uses within the City’s established goals of increased riverfront access, robust and equitable open space and trail systems, bank stabilization, improved public safety, and improved environmental quality.
To temporarily address the lack of a cohesive riverfront zoning approach, and while a permanent solution was being developed, the Department of City Planning created a Riverfront Interim Planning Overlay District (IPOD), unanimously approved by City Council and adopted in June 2016. The Riverfront IPOD provided additional standards for some demolition, new or expanded development, and new or expanded surface parking with the objectives of ensuring riverfront access, improving public safety, providing for public and design review processes, understanding transportation network impacts, reconnecting neighborhoods with their riverfronts, and improving riverfront ecology and environmental health.
The Riverfront Zoning Amendment built on the Riverfront IPOD, as well as work from a number of previous planning efforts. It established an approach to land development that responded to the City’s changing economy, and that recognized and accommodated the diverse uses and characteristics of Pittsburgh’s riverfronts. The process and resulting Riverfront Zoning Amendment sought to balance industrial, commercial, residential, and recreational uses – addressing potential conflicts with the goal of reinforcing the existing character, the “grit and shine” that define the City of Pittsburgh and its riverfront.

Sheraden Park Master Plan

Read the Sheraden Park Master Plan(PDF, 63MB)
The Sheraden Park Master Plan is a recommendation of the City’s Open Space, Parks and Recreation Plan, adopted in July 2013. The Open Space Plan recommended Sheraden Park’s designation as a signature community park. Sheraden Park’s scale makes it a site with strong potential to be expanded and redeveloped, thereby serving a larger population and providing green premium benefits to areas not benefitting from proximity to the City’s five regional parks. Signature community parks are prioritized because they have the greatest potential to fill gaps in the green premium, provide better and more diverse recreation experiences, and focus investment. Signature sites should receive a higher level of capital and maintenance funding than other community parks, have site-specific programming, and incorporate design features to highlight their specific identities. Regional-scale recreation facilities can be targeted for signature community parks, as well as community-scale recreation facilities.
The Open Space Plan recommends the following for Sheraden Park:


- Expand and redevelop, with a high level of investment.
- Designate this site as a signature community park
- Sheraden Park has enormous potential to be expanded and redeveloped to become one of Pittsburgh’s signature community parks, with its forests, hills, and valleys defining its character.
- Expand Sheraden Park to include the series of public parcels that connect to McGonigle Park on the west and further south from McGonigle to the skate park, including 29 other parcels outlined in OpenSpacePGH on page 21 of Appendix G: Park Evaluation and Project List.
- Work with the Allegheny County Sanitary Authority pursuing the acquisition of the Duquesne Light Property to determine if further expansion or river access is feasible.
- Develop a new master plan that provides a vision for the expanded site (Sheraden Park, McGonigle Park, public parcels) and that uses the community park design guidelines as a starting point.
- In the Master Plan, address the relationship of the scattered facilities and evaluate the elimination of defunct or remote facilities.
- Consider new facilities for this site in the Master Plan with the purpose of creating a critical mass of outdoor recreation facilities that take advantage of the site’s expansiveness and sinuous character.
- Consider the addition of a dog park.
- Implement the new Master Plan.

The South Side Park Master Plan is an outcome of the City’s comprehensive Open Space Plan (2013) which identified South Side Park as a potential Signature Community Park in need of a master plan that includes neighboring Arlington Park and harnesses the City’s energy for creating an inclusive space that offers recreation, programming, connectivity and ecologic systems within its urban context. The site is inherently dramatic, providing both opportunities and challenges for public space-making. Design decisions will take cues from the unique culture and spaces within South Side Park’s energetic community and rich landscape, which engages the site’s natural systems while also providing a strategic plan for providing phased community resources. The outcome to generate a master plan that presents a strategy for implementation and suggested phasing for individual projects that may be easily adopted into future city budgets and by various other funding sources. Projects will be achievable and representative pieces of the larger vision of a unified framework that both builds community pride and helps to guide future capital investments.

Status

The EcoInnovation District Plan was formally adopted by the City Planning Commission on September 12, 2017. Since that time, the community has organized the Uptown Task Force, which provides district governance and collaboration. There are four subcommittees of the Uptown Task Force that focus on implementing the four chapters of the plan. The task force meets every month, and the subcommittees adopt annual work plans that focus their activities on priority projects. Early projects including rezoning the Uptown area to incentivize development consistent with community goals, a community-driven proposal for a publicly-owned development site at Fifth and Dinwiddie, and a number of park and stormwater management projects.

What's an EcoInnovation District?

The EcoInnovation District in Pittsburgh is the first of its kind. It is a groundbreaking initiative that combines the goals of both EcoDistricts and Innovation Districts that have helped to positively transform communities across the country. The EcoInnovation District is an opportunity to utilize the ways in which redevelopment can improve the environment, support the needs of existing residents, and expand entrepreneurship and job growth.
EcoDistricts emphasizes a bottom-up model of planning and development to create a resilient and sustainable city. They reflect a new approach to development focused on economic opportunity, universal access, smart and efficient infrastructure, and green building practices.
Innovation Districts are focused on job growth and economic opportunity. Innovation districts that are walkable, bikeable, and transit-oriented result in healthier, happier lifestyles for local residents, foster greater equity in access, and create a better environment for businesses to succeed.
The creation of the EcoInnovation District Plan was a two-year process to help support the community and assets within Uptown and West Oakland, and to help spur development and revitalize this major corridor between Downtown and Oakland. With new projects on the horizon in Pittsburgh, such as the bus rapid transit system, Uptown has an opportunity to grow and create a more welcoming environment for residents. Since the adoption of the EID plan by the city's Planning Commission in September 2017. Following adoption, community organizations, institutions, employers, and public agency partners have worked together to implement the plan through projects and programs.

The Neighborhood

Uptown extends along the Fifth and Forbes Avenue corridors from I-579 to Robinson Street and is nestled between two of the top three largest employment centers in Pennsylvania — Downtown Pittsburgh and Oakland. In 2015, there were 109,050 jobs in Greater Downtown Pittsburgh, including 8,000 jobs in Uptown. Many of Uptown’s jobs are linked to Duquesne University, UPMC’s Mercy Hospital and the district’s growing biomedical and technology startup spaces. Greater Downtown accounts for nearly 40% of all jobs in Pittsburgh. To the east, Oakland is home to the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, Carlow University, world class medicine at UPMC’s Magee and Presbyterian Hospitals, and a growing number of small and established businesses. An investment in Uptown is within a short commute to over 150,000 jobs. To support Pittsburgh’s growing economy, Uptown is uniquely positioned to provide new spaces in a location easily accessible to these job centers.
Today, there approximately 1,000 residents that are extremely diverse in terms of income and race. With a large and active population of artists and activists, Uptown has a distinctive character and deep pride about its history and future. Institutions play a prominent role in Uptown as a source of employment, as anchor real estate holders and contributors to the wellbeing of the community. There are over 20 institutions providing a range of services to community members in Uptown and beyond. These institutions, both large and small, form an essential social fabric of the community and support what is an emerging innovation community. Avenu and Duquesne University both actively support research and small business activities and the community is home to vision and hearing research and services, small biotech companies, creative businesses and makers.

What’s in the Plan

The EcoInnovation District Plan is comprised of four main chapters that address strengths, weaknesses, and opportunities to be built upon in order to help reinvest in Uptown and support current and future residents. Each of these chapters — Community, Development, Mobility, and Infrastructure — are broken into actionable items by the City of Pittsburgh, community leaders, and other partners. For more information on each item, see the corresponding chapter within the plan.
More public engagement details can be found starting on page 10 of theEcoInnovation District Plan(PDF, 80MB).

Community

Over the past century, Uptown and West Oakland have faced many significant challenges. What was at one time a diverse community of about 8,500 people in 1910, many of which worked in adjacent factories and mills, declined to 3,220 residents in 1990 of which 58% or 1,860 were students. During this decline, major institutions stepped in to create campuses that today provide thousands of jobs to Pittsburgh residents. The result is not just a loss of population, but of the townhomes, small scale warehouses, and structures that make Uptown unique. Of the 6,600 residents in the community according to the 2010 Census, about 5,930 of these are either students living on Duquesne’s campus or prisoners in the Allegheny County Jail along the River.
Today there are about 1,000 residents in Uptown who face many day-to-day challenges. Concerns about rising housing prices, crime (both real and perceived) and the continued loss of historic buildings are frequently raised. The core of the EcoInnovation District Plan is to ensure that Uptown not only grows equitably, but that job opportunities are accessible to residents, and that the community can tackle long-standing day-to-day challenges -- all while keeping Uptown, Uptown.
Concept Map
1.1 Invest in existing residents & protect the residential core of the community


- Create a housing advocate for uptown.
- Explore tax policies to prevent displacement.

- Launch a targeted marketing strategy.
- Create new community programming.
- Expand local fitness programs.
1.4 Work together to tackle vacancy and community safety


- Monitor and address illegal dumping and nuisance properties.
- Upgrade lighting.
- Expand community policing.
1.5 Expand institutional partnerships


- Connect local institutions.
- Work with major institutions to expand their research, curriculum and student activities into the community where appropriate.
Details for each of these strategies can be found in the Community Chapter of theEID Plan(PDF, 80MB).

Development

Given Uptown’s unique location, it’s remarkable that investment has, in many ways, bypassed the community. According to the land use survey analysis conducted at the beginning of the EcoInnovation process, 37% of the land in Uptown is underutilized - consisting of surface parking lots or vacant buildings/land. Pittsburgh’s office market is approaching “Full” and Uptown is primed to absorb some of the spillover investment from Downtown and Oakland. As the City’s innovation economy grows, small and growing businesses will need affordable space to succeed. Uptown contains a building types that have historically supported a mix of small scale manufacturing and light industry. These buildings are often well-suited for such start-up businesses through reuse. To maximize the potential of Uptown as a home for small businesses, it is imperative to preserve these buildings and work to fill them with new activity.
Uptown also has the potential to meet growing demand for housing. In order to meet this demand and help prevent a rise in housing costs, new development should be encouraged. Through a mix of new construction as well as rehabilitation of existing vacant buildings, there is ample opportunity to meet the demand while preserving Uptown’s existing character, and ultimately re-establish the vibrant mix of uses that once characterized the Fifth and Forbes corridors. To encourage investment but also retain Uptown’s character, the existing zoning needs to be replaced. Using the City’s p4 initiative as inspiration, the proposed Uptown Public Realm District seeks to simplify the existing code but also incentivize new development in ways that help to address some major issues in the community including affordability, stormwater, energy, and preservation.
Concept Map
2.1 Diversify Housing Options


- Make housing options available and affordable to a diverse income range.
- Look for opportunities to create new senior housing.
- Create student housing to relieve pressure on existing housing.
2.2 Create Space for Innovation


- Connect start ups with flexible spaces to fit their needs.
- Work with developers to provide workspace.
- Support housing typologies that support collaborative creative production and innovation.
Revive Commercial Corridors


- Oversee corridor management efforts as a part of EID district management.
- Retain existing businesses.
- Encourage existing and new businesses to improve curb appeal.
- Attract new retail & commercial tenants.
Implement Policies to Promote Sustainable & Affordable Development


- Encourage density and mixed uses in targeted areas.
- Manage parking district wide and create community infrastructure hubs.
- Rewrite zoning for the EID based on performance.
Details for each of these strategies can be found in the Community Chapter of theEID Plan(PDF, 80MB).

Mobility

Uptown and West Oakland’s transportation system is one of the community’s biggest assets, with some of Pittsburgh’s most robust transit, bridge, and highway connections. On the other hand, this same infrastructure – and its associated traffic – often serve to overwhelm the neighborhood, encouraging trips through Uptown and West Oakland rather than to them. This generates a significant amount of vehicular traffic, traffic crashes, and air and noise pollution.
After housing, transportation is typically the second highest factor in a household’s cost of living, and residents of Uptown have many opportunities to reduce these costs. Operating, insuring, and maintaining a car costs an average of $9,000 per year. Because of its walkable scale (if not walkable streets) and frequent buses along Fifth and Forbes Avenues, it’s possible to live without a car in Uptown – and some people do. But walking, bicycling and taking transit is not always easy in Uptown. Some steep hills, poor sidewalks and fast moving traffic makes walking unpleasant and at times unsafe. There are no bike lanes that protect bicyclers from traffic, buses often get stuck in traffic due to large commuter use, and often residents must leave the neighborhood to acquire basic household goods. While the study area’s modest size may preclude changes at the regional or citywide scale, the EcoInnovation District is the perfect size to test and refine the most innovative emerging concepts in sustainable and equitable urban mobility, serving as a proof-of-concept well beyond the borders of Uptown and West Oakland.
Concept Map
3.1 Increase Transportation Choice to Decrease Congestion


- Encourage walking, biking, and taking transit for trips to, from, and within the EcoInnovation district.
- Ensure transit meets the needs of local users.
- Get more people riding together.
- Expand a Transportation Management Association (TMA) to include uptown.
- Expand mobility across all income levels.
3.2 Create a Safe and Livable Street Network


- Achieve zero traffic fatalities and zero serious injuries within uptown.
- Identify "Slow streets" coordinated with transit emphasis on Fifth/Forbes.
- Improve safety of cross street connections with boulevard of the allies for all modes.
- Prioritize sidewalk improvements based on need and critical pathways.
- Improve safety and quality of pedestrian experience crossing under bridge and overpass infrastructure.
3.3 Implement Bus Rapid Transit on Fifth and Forbes Avenues


- Provide a transit only lane on both fifth and Forbes and integrate pedestrian improvements into BRT design.
- Use BRT construction to begin the shift away from single occupancy vehicles (SOVs).
3.4 Build a Smarter Uptown


- Encourage implementation of SmartPGH sensor network in uptown; smart spines on fifth and Forbes.
- Make real-time transportation data available in the public realm.
- Encourage automated vehicle (av) pilot projects in uptown.
- Bring Electric Vehicle (EV) charging stations to uptown.
3.5 Establish a District Parking Strategy


- Make parking policy “work” for uptown residents.
- Implement dynamic parking management strategy for uptown / west Oakland.
- Partner with institutions and major employers to develop transportation demand management (tdm) programs.
- Establish a major-event management strategy in partnership with the PPG paints arena.
3.6 Invest in Bicycle Infrastructure & Culture


- Infill existing bike network with safe, all-ages facilities.
- Make the bike community more visible.
- Expand bike share in uptown and west Oakland.
- Grow regional bike trail network and connections to / from uptown.
Details for each of these strategies can be found in the Community Chapter of theEID Plan(PDF, 80MB).

Infrastructure

Uptown is blessed with some potentially amazing natural assets: an incredible wooded hillside to the northeast that could serve in both an open space and ecological capacity; and a stunning 180-degree view down to the Monongahela River — if one could safely connect to the hillside bluff overlooking the river. It also boasts an emerging urban agriculture movement, experiments in public art and landscape throughout the neighborhood, small but socially important gathering spaces like the Tustin Street Playground and community garden, and an incredibly energetic set of residents at work in these spaces and efforts.
Unfortunately, many of these assets are yet untapped or mostly unrealized. They lack physical and visual access to them, connections between and among them, and have limited resources to support major upgrades or expansion except for the time and efforts and personal contributions of those active in their founding, installation, and upkeep. The opportunity is to improve these open spaces, connect them, create new ones that help to manage the stormwater that negatively impacts the community.
The EcoInnovation District also carefully studied the opportunity to reduce waste and reuse more and, creating district energy for all in the community. These activities can provide more resilient infrastructure for residents but also reduce costs and provide valuable materials like clean soil through composting that supports the efforts of local gardeners and farmers.
Concept Map
4.1 Create and Expand Open Space Amenities for Residents


- Create a new Civic Plaza at Fifth and Dinwiddie.
- Expand the Tustin Street Gardens / tot lot into a Community Park.
- Transform the Hillside into an open space amenity and Stormwater Park.
- Develop a new blue alley on Watson street on the western end.
- Integrate new green space at Forbes and Stevenson to capture stormwater and support new local uses.
4.2 Create New Green Connections


- Create clear connections to the heritage trail.
- Improve Colwell as a green connector.
- Transform Boulevard of the Allies into uptown's riverfront.
4.3 Use Landscape to Enhance Local Quality of Life


- Encourage alternative approaches to managing vacant land.
- Maximize and connect local food production opportunities.
- Integrate street trees.
- Manage district vegetation.
- Monitor and improve environmental health.
4.4 Update Underground Infrastructure


- Focus on stormwater retention strategies at the surface to ease the burden on sewer systems.
- Update sewer / water laterals where possible.
4.5 Pursue District Energy


- Reduce energy burden.
- Coordinate infrastructure installation with BRT.
- Establish multi-user micro grids.
- Remote use of combined heat & power.
- Encourage installation of solar PV in underutilized air space.
- Encourage recycling waste food as an alternative energy source.
- Extend the 2030 district into uptown.
4.6 Become a Model for Innovative Waste Management


- Strive to become a zero waste community.
- Enforce recycling mandate.
- Provide public trash and recycling receptacles where needed.
- Establish a district composting program.
Details for each of these strategies can be found in the Community Chapter of theEID Plan(PDF, 80MB).

Status

The Greater Hill District Master Plan Steering Committee spent Winter 2020 collaborating with staff to develop a Public Engagement Plan. During Winter 2020 and Spring 2020, Steering Committee meetings focused on establishing a firm baseline of knowledge about the topics of the planning process by completing a Gap analysis based on the original Greater Hill District Master Plan and the Neighborhood Plan Guide. All presentations can be found on the Steering Committee page. The next step is to engage the broader community through the City's online engagement portal - Engage PGH - to build upon the existing vision and goals for the Hill District to guide the Action Teams as they focus on the four topic areas of the plan: community, development, mobility, and infrastructure. This process will update and enhance the Greater Hill District Master Plan (2011) and incorporate other community plans including the Greenprint (2009) and the Centre Avenue Redevelopment and Design Plan (2015), adopting it as city policy.

The Neighborhood

As one of Pittsburgh’s earliest and largest neighborhoods, the Hill District continues to play an important role in the story of African-Americans in the United States. During the first half of the 20th century, the Hill District was the “crossroads of the world,” contributing music, literature, and arts that shaped American culture. During the latter half of the 20th century through today, the neighborhood and its leaders played important roles in the Civil Rights movement, as well as a nationwide push for community-led development. The Greater Hill District Master Plan articulates the importance of continuing to “Build Upon the African American Cultural Legacy”.
The Hill District Greenprint (2009) created a bold vision for a natural and healthy community, the Greater Hill District Master Plan (2011) established fundamental values and development principles that have been central to development activities and the neighborhood ecosystem. The Centre Avenue Redevelopment and Design Plan (2015)using a market study as its basis, created a detailed vision for how new development and amenities on Centre Avenue could serve a variety of community needs.
Multiple waves of development have built new office, commercial and community spaces along Centre Avenue, along with new housing throughout the neighborhood. Development activities in Downtown and Oakland have the potential to bring new opportunities and challenges to the Hill District the plan will seek to address.

Homewood Community Plan


The Neighborhood

In the early 20th century, changing industry and increasing growth beyond downtown led to the development of the Homewood community. The increased population needed transportation and a system of streetcar lines was constructed to connect the neighborhood to downtown. During the 1950s, Homewood experienced residential growth with displaced residents from the Lower Hill and Homewood to become one of Pittsburgh's largest African-American neighborhoods.
Homewood consists of three neighborhoods – Homewood North, Homewood West, and Homewood South – with a combined population of 6,442, which is 94% African-American, as of the 2010 census. Homewood is predominantly residential with commercial activities concentrated on Frankstown Road and Homewood Avenue corridors. Of the 5,194 parcels that make up Homewood, 49.6% are vacant, according to a 2014 Operation Better Block survey. This plan will aim to provide strategies that will increase housing, development, mobility, and infrastructure in an equitable way.
Homewood has a valuable ecosystem of dedicated community organizations and leaders who have worked to develop plans for parts of the neighborhood. The residents, stakeholders, and institutions of Homewood have worked to rebuild and envision a Homewood of the future. This planning process built off that foundation and establishes a common vision and direction for the Homewood community.

The Vision for the Future of Homewood

Homewood will be an African-American cultural destination where people choose to live, work, worship, and visit. It will be safe, green, healthy, and innovative. It will have quality schools. It will be a place that protects long-term and low-income residents and equips them to be engaged and informed.

The Plan


Manchester Chateau Neighborhood Plan


The Neighborhood

Manchester-Chateau is a neighborhood with a rich history and an enduring legacy. In many ways, it tells the story of Pittsburgh’s history, reflecting both the positive and challenging aspects of the city’s identity. Manchester-Chateau has the most historically significant collection of architecture of any neighborhood in Pittsburgh, boasts a proud legacy as a premier African American neighborhood in the city, and links directly to the legacy of Andrew Carnegie. The construction of State Route 65 in the 1960s, however, dramatically changed the neighborhood’s landscape. After dividing Manchester and Chateau as well as gutting the commercial core along Beaver Avenue, SR 65 has caused major challenges for the neighborhood, including commercial disinvestment and limited access.
Today, on the east side of SR 65, Manchester thrives with a wealth of historically significant resources and vital heritage as the leading African-American neighborhood in Pittsburgh. On the west side of SR 65, Chateau flourishes as an economically successful industrial and institutional area with almost no residential buildings and limited access to the riverfront. Overall, it is a neighborhood physically and practically divided by SR 65. Manchester-Chateau is on the verge of great change. The Pittsburgh community is realizing the amazing assets of this neighborhood and steering investment here. Shifting demographics, interest and policy changes along the riverfront are among the factors driving opportunity and challenges in the evolution of this vital Pittsburgh neighborhood.
With this interest in the Manchester portion of the neighborhood comes challenges. As more residents are attracted to the area, there are dangers that rising housing prices will challenge some who have long called this area home. New housing options should complement the needs of the community and create a balance of various housing prices throughout Manchester to encourage development without displacement. In addition, much of this area is underserved by local neighborhood-scale commercial uses. Whether restaurants, personal and medical services or access to groceries, the loss of the commercial core resulting from decades-old highway construction has never been remedied. This extends to the lost elements in the public open spaces of the neighborhood. To recreate a cohesive neighborhood identity, these public spaces and commercial cores must be re-established.
West of the highway, opportunities are emerging along the riverfront with new uses likely to complement the largely industrial, warehousing and institutional structures currently located there. Larger sites and the opportunity to connect to the greater riverfront are driving potential development projects that will look very different from what is there today. With a newly adopted Riverfront Zoning District, it is likely that these types of development proposals will become increasingly frequent. Questions of the mix of uses and how affordable housing will be accommodated will be paramount as this transition occurs. In addition, how new developments relate to the riverfront and incorporate new publicly-accessible open space will be important.

What’s in the Plan

The Manchester-Chateau Neighborhood Plan(PDF, 88MB)is comprised of four main chapters that address strengths, weaknesses and opportunities to be built upon in order to help reunite Manchester and Chateau through the development of public infrastructure, improved housing affordability, and other neighborhood elements. Each of these chapters — Community, Development, Mobility, and Infrastructure — are broken into actionable items by the City of Pittsburgh, community leaders and other partners.
For more information on each item, see the corresponding chapter within the plan.

Introduction

Manchester-Chateau is a neighborhood with a rich history and an enduring legacy. It is the story of Pittsburgh's history in many ways, reflecting both the positive and the challenging aspects of the city's identity. Highway construction divided the community, making a neighborhood on one side of the highway with a wealth of significant historic resources and a vital heritage as the leading African-American neighborhood with almost no access to the riverfront. And on the other side of the highway, an economically successful industrial and institutional area with almost no residential buildings and limited riverfront access.
Manchester-Chateau is on the verge of great change. The Pittsburgh community is realizing the assets of this neighborhood and steering investment here. Shifting demographics, interest and policy changes along the riverfront are among the factors driving opportunity and challenges in the evolution of this vital Pittsburgh neighborhood.
Introduction(PDF, 36MB)

Community

Community(PDF, 9MB)
Since SR 65 split the neighborhood in the 1960s, there has been a growing need in Manchester-Chateau to recreate a cohesive neighborhood identity despite its deep history and legacy. As one of Pittsburgh’s oldest neighborhoods, Manchester has many historic, yet aging, homes. The median age of a housing unit in Manchester is 98 years old, which lends issues of maintenance and housing costs. Additionally, the attraction of more people to the area raises the primary concern of housing affordability. From 2014 to 2017, population growth in Manchester increased by 12.7%, higher than both the City of Pittsburgh and Allegheny County. At the same time, income inequality and poverty increased in Manchester but decreased for the City and County. Furthermore, the median rent has increased by 35% while the median household income has only increased by 20% from 2012 to 2017.
Overall, there stands a strong need to preserve and maintain the historic quality and affordability of housing. Developing a housing trust to facilitate affordable housing in Manchester as well as incorporating affordable housing in mixed-use projects in Chateau will help achieve these goals. Promoting a safe and healthy neighborhood along with incorporating cultural heritage through public art will also improve the quality of life for residents and help cultivate Manchester-Chateau’s identity.

Development

Development(PDF, 5MB)
Due to SR 65 dividing the neighborhood, land use is quite distinct between Manchester and Chateau. On the east, Manchester has a largely residential mix, with commercial areas generally located in corridors at the neighborhood edges and in some nodes within. On the west, Chateau is predominantly industrial and institutional, with some commercial and office spaces as well. In 2018, Chateau’s zoning code was updated through the Riverfront Zoning Update, which condensed a dozen zoning classifications into five more simplified districts. These districts permit the types of office and residential development that is supported by changing market-demand. They also incentivize both the development of affordable housing and sustainable infrastructure.
There is a lot of potential for redevelopment in the neighborhood. Approximately 10% of all land in Manchester and Chateau is vacant. In Manchester, the Western Avenue area poses the most significant and feasible opportunity to add new residential units along with mixed-use spaces. The development of ground-floor commercial/retail space with residential/office above will provide the neighborhood with a dense, vibrant, mixed-use heart. In Chateau, land use is shifting from industrial and warehousing to higher-density, mixed-use development. The development of additional residential units will also help establish street-level activity. To aid development in Manchester-Chateau and encourage economic development, various funding strategies must be implemented, including a housing trust to facilitate affordable housing development, a Transit Revitalization Investment District (TRID) to fund projects, and grant programs to support public infrastructure.
Goal 10: Promote Western Avenue as a Vibrant, Mixed-use Commercial District.


- Re-evaluate applicable zoning along Western Avenue in order to promote desired uses.
- Investigate zoning performance standards to achieve the following desired characteristics for the district:Ground floor commercial (office or retail)Residential units above (4-6 stories)Building materials and design that are historically appropriate for the neighborhood.Incorporate gateway signage outlined in the Community section on the corner of Western Ave. And Allegheny Ave.Active street frontages that prioritize pedestrian accessNo new surface parking or driveways


    * Ground floor commercial (office or retail)
    * Residential units above (4-6 stories)
    * Building materials and design that are historically appropriate for the neighborhood.
    * Incorporate gateway signage outlined in the Community section on the corner of Western Ave. And Allegheny Ave.
    * Active street frontages that prioritize pedestrian access
    * No new surface parking or driveways
Goal 11: Strengthen and Diversify Existing Land Use in Chateau.


- Align future development with the future land use plan outlined in the Development Chapter.
- Leverage the riverfront and planned green corridors for future development.
Goal 12: Develop a Housing Trust to Ensure Affordability for Future Generations.


- Identify stakeholders, including a principle acting agency.
- Define organizational structure and scale.

Mobility

Mobility(PDF, 7MB)
A safe and efficient transportation system is critical to connecting residents to opportunities and services within the neighborhood as well as throughout the rest of Pittsburgh. In Manchester, the dense network of narrow, residential streets helps promote walking and biking in the neighborhood. However, its one-way streets pose several safety concerns by causing confusion in navigating the neighborhood, encouraging higher travel speeds, and reducing overall connectivity. Aside from walking and biking, residents may use the existing bus transit and metro line. Approximately 10% of households in Manchester do not own a vehicle, and thus, rely heavily on public transit.
In relation to SR 65, the overall mobility of Manchester-Chateau faces five distinct challenges. These involve the safety on Beaver Avenue and Chateau Street, improvements to the Juniata Intersection, traffic flow, additional connections between Manchester-Chateau and the riverfront, and future changes for SR 65. Transforming it into an at-grade boulevard with Beaver Avenue and Chateau Street or expanding the span under the bridge are options to reduce the negative impacts of SR 65.
Goal 15: Enhance Safety Through Roadway Design Improvements.


- Evaluate local streets for opportunities to improve safety at key crossings for pedestrians and cyclists.
- Explore traffic calming techniques to decrease vehicle speeds, appropriate for local neighborhood streets.
- Evaluate appropriateness of existing one-way streets and explore options for conversion to two-way traffic.
Goal 16: Improve Quality and Access to Public Transit Services.


- Enhance design of bus stops to showcase local artists and community heritage.
- Conduct a Allegheny T-Stop Multimodal Access Plan to identify multimodal improvements to the connect to T station.
Goal 17: Improve Pedestrian and Bicyclist Infrastructure.


- Address gaps in the sidewalk network and bring sidewalks and ADA ramps to an acceptable condition.
- Implement bicycle and pedestrian infrastructure per Mode Emphasis Map.
- Improve connections to regional/city trail networks.
- Create partnership to encourage the use of bicycling as an affordable, convenient mode of transportation. Include bike programming in community events.
Goal 18: Reconnect Manchester and Chateau Through a New Vision for the State Route 65 Network.


- Implement near-term safety improvements on Chateau St. & Beaver St. to create pedestrian-safe transition zones.
- Implement Juniata underpass improvements.
- Strengthen connections between Manchester and Chateau by making investments that promote connectivity and safety, and are multi-modal in nature.
- Conduct long-term transportation analysis exploring the feasibility and cost/benefit of long-term changes to SR-65 and options to create additional access points through SR-65.
- Construct green corridors and trail improvements to connect Manchester-Chateau to the river.
- Open space under the bridge to create recreational space and safe connections between the riverfront and the neighborhood.

Infrastructure

Infrastructure(PDF, 5MB)
Manchester-Chateau residents are concerned with the wellbeing and sustainability of the neighborhood’s environment. In particular, air quality is rather poor due to the presence of manufacturing along the river as well as the topography of the city. The neighborhood also faces higher levels of nitrogen dioxide and hotter surface temperatures. The existing ReLeaf Manchester Plan helps mitigate these problems by expanding the tree canopy and coverage. Other efforts that will benefit both Manchester-Chateau’s environment and residents’ safety include implementing green infrastructure, such as street medians, bioswales and rain gardens, and permeable pavers.
The neighborhood has few spaces for public gathering or recreation but Manchester Park, Manchester Field Park, and McKnight Park serve both these functions. These three existing neighborhood parks in Manchester require a refreshed approach to continue serving the needs of residents while preserving the character and heritage of the neighborhood.
Goal 19: Incorporate Green Infrastructure in Capital Improvement Projects.


- Develop environmental guidelines and a template for the community to use when reviewing proposed development.
- Incorporate green infrastructure where appropriate in development review and in Community Benefits Agreements.
- Incorporate green infrastructure, including stormwater, in public infrastructure investments.
- Develop a program to educate and assist residents to build rain barrels for their property.

The Neighborhood

Pittsburgh’s Oakland is composed of four city-designated neighborhoods: West Oakland, North Oakland, Central Oakland, and South Oakland. The district these four neighborhoods form possesses an unparalleled combination of academic, medical, and cultural institutions surrounded by a vibrant residential community. Oakland’s academic institutions are also major employers and generators of economic activity throughout Western Pennsylvania, including the University of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University, the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, and Carlow University. Oakland has an extraordinary complement of cultural institutions, including the Carnegie Museum of Art, Carnegie Museum of Natural History, Carnegie Hall, the main branch of the Carnegie Library, and the nearby Phipps Conservatory. Activity extends to the riverfront portions of Oakland, where the Pittsburgh Technology Center continues to grow and add office and R&D buildings as well as parking, hospitality, and other uses. Finally, The Port Authority of Allegheny County, in partnership with the City of Pittsburgh, is currently in the design phase of a Bus Rapid Transit system that will better connect Downtown and Oakland with the East End and nearby neighborhoods. The project will introduce designated bus-only lanes that will reduce travel times and bring other streetscape improvements, including physically separated bike lanes, street trees, and stormwater infrastructure to the Fifth and Forbes Avenue corridor.

Due to COVID-19,new guidelines(PDF, 117KB)have been established for gardens. Please read and follow the guidelines to ensure you and other gardeners stay safe and healthy.COVID-19 Gardening Guidelines(PDF, 117KB)
In 2013, the City's Open Space Plan recommended that a streamlined process be created to allow residents to access city-owned vacant land to beautify their communities and to hire a point person to manage the projects. In 2014, the city hired an Open Space Specialist, and began to engage community stakeholders like GTECH, Grow Pittsburgh, Western Pennsylvania Conservancy, Penn State Extension, and Tree Pittsburgh, as well as city departments with a concern as to what happens on city land including Real Estate, Finance, Public Works, the Mayor's Office, and Sustainability. The result was theVacant Lot Toolkit(PDF, 9MB), a guide to transforming vacant lots into community assets.
The Adopt-A-Lot program, developed as part of the Vacant Lot Toolkit, was created to allow residents a streamlined process by which to access city-owned vacant lots for food, flower, or rain gardens. In an effort to combat the problem of vacant city-owned lots, the program had three goals:


- Foster neighborhood interaction
- Re-imagine the potential of vacant lots
- Encourage environmental awareness
In the first two years, 114 vacant lots have been transformed around the city as part of 40 community projects — a total of 10 acres of formerly vacant land now community assets.

Greenways

Definition of a Greenway

In Pittsburgh, “greenway” is defined by City Council designation as a permanent, passive open space that serves to benefit adjacent neighborhoods and the general public. “Reserved for greenway” was also defined as areas being studied or planned for designation. In 1980, the Greenways for Pittsburgh program was established to consolidate steeply sloped, unbuildable land for the purpose of protecting hillsides and preserving passive open space resources.
Today, the city has designated twelve greenways totaling 605 acres — 61.5 acres of which are contained in Emerald View Park, and a combined 8.9 acres of which are contained within three neighborhood parks. Greenways comprise 14% of Pittsburgh’s public open space. Another 21 greenways have been discussed conceptually and would add over 450 acres to the system. To put this into perspective, Pittsburgh's largest park, Frick Park, is 644 acres.
Since the inception of the Greenways for Pittsburgh Program, the City has undergone severe economic hardship resulting in limited staff and maintenance time devoted to these open spaces. Accordingly, the current program lacks components such as stewardship, suitability analysis for greenway designations, and process. Other issues include the need for low-cost open space, natural amenity open space, and the defining quality of Pittsburgh that are our greenways.
Due to the lack of enforcement capacity, and in some cases, their remote locations, the City’s greenways are vulnerable to over-use and illegal or inappropriate activities such as dumping, squatting and motorized ATV use. Greenways are also negatively impacted by insects, disease and invasive species. Issues that are not currently funded interventions are required to address these issues.
The public process for theOpen Space Plan(PDF, 20MB)showed a desire for more greenways, access to trails/natural areas, connectivity of the open space network, as well as the protection of existing natural areas not designated as greenways. The perception of communities that large areas of undeveloped land are designated greenways, lack of continuous ownership and minimal city resources for these lands is problematic.

Greenways for Pittsburgh

The Greenways for Pittsburgh 2.0 is a recommendation of the Open Space Plan (the City’s Open Space, Parks, and Recreation Plan), which was adopted in July 2013, to expand and enhance the City’s greenways (Strategy U) as well as developing a network of hiking/mountain biking trails (Strategy X/Y). As a separate recommendation of theOpen Space Plan(PDF, 20MB), a Natural Resources Manager (Strategy T) position is to be developed to manage our natural resources and conservation efforts. The Greenways for Pittsburgh 2.0 project will begin to explore that position and the role it will play to increase stewardship of these lands. Development and design guidelines were also developed for greenway (Appendix H) to provide intent, characteristics, considerations and items to avoid.

- Greenways Resource Guide(PDF, 11MB)
- Greenways Policy Guide(PDF, 5MB)
- Community Engagement Toolkit(PDF, 4MB)
The Greenways for Pittsburgh 2.0 project intent is to be a refresh of our Greenways for Pittsburgh program. The project will create policy and stewardship components with the goals to foster stewardship, improve the quality, connectivity and accessibility to these open spaces, as well as strive for the highest level of sustainability in regards to conservation, green infrastructure and maintenance. The outcome of the program will be the development and implementation of greenways to meet the public need/desire for proximate open space.

Building Benchmarking Compliance


What is benchmarking?

Building benchmarking is measuring the energy and water use, and using that data to compare performance over time as well as compare to similar buildings. Benchmarking allows owners and occupants to understand the relative energy, water and waste. This information helps to make strategic decisions that will save money and energy while improving comfort and health. Starting in 2018, owners of non-residential buildings larger than 50,000 sq. ft. are required to benchmark annually.

What are the benefits of benchmarking?


Economic Benefits

With energy and water costs accounting for an average of 26.8% of office building operating costs nationally, efficiency improvements can help building owners and tenants significantly reduce utility bills. These savings can be put to other needs such as the purchase of goods and services, which drive local economic activity. Making city buildings more efficient also creates jobs at all skill levels, and frees up money to flow back into the local economy.

Public Health Benefits

More than 166 million people, roughly 52% of the U.S. population, lives amidst pollution levels that are too dangerous to breathe. Fossil-fueled power plants are responsible for much of the nation’s sulfur dioxide, which fouls the air. Based on the 2013 sector-based inventory, Pittsburgh’s buildings are responsible for 81% of carbon emissions through the consumption of electricity and natural gas. Energy efficiency is a low-cost energy strategy that reduces pollution by reducing demand for existing and new energy production.

Low-Income Benefits

Urban center account for more than 80% of global greenhouse gas emissions. Low-income communities face the greatest exposure to aging and poorly constructed housing and coal-burning power plants, both of which can lead to health issues disproportionately impacting this portion of our communities.

How does building benchmarking fit into OnePGH initiatives?

Building benchmarking is a foundational step toward achieving the city’s 2030 goals. For internal city operations, goals include 100% renewable energy use, a 100% fossil fuel-free fleet, and divestment from fossil fuels. For the City of Pittsburgh, goals include a 50% energy use reduction, 50% transportation emission reduction, and to become zero-waste and divest from landfills.

What is the City Energy Project?

TheCity Energy Projectis a national initiative to create healthier and more prosperous American cities by improving the energy efficiency of buildings. Working in partnership, the Project and cities support innovative, practical solutions that cut energy waste, boost local economies, and reduce harmful pollution. The City Energy Project is providing support to assist with the implementation of the ordinance in Pittsburgh.
The pioneering actions of the 20 cities involved in the City Energy Project will be models for communities around the world. City Energy Project Cities include:


- Atlanta, GA
- Boston, MA
- Chicago, IL
- Des Moines, IA
- Fort Collins, CO
- Houston, TX

Registered Community Organizations


Registered Community Organization (RCO) Program

The City of Pittsburgh’s Registered Community Organization Program was created in 2019 with the intent to:


- Foster informed and inclusive participation from as many neighborhood stakeholders as possible in development processes.
- Enhance cooperation and the flow of information between community organizations, stakeholders, City departments, and various development agencies.
- Empower community organizations to engage in civic affairs, improving neighborhood livability and character.

What is an RCO & what do they do?



- An RCO is a non-profit community organization or collaboration of community organizations that are registered with the Department of City Planning (DCP) as stakeholders of a specific geographic area.
- RCOs help residents and businesses obtain and share information, support community networks, and work to improve the quality of life in their neighborhoods. RCOs also play a key role in the development process by hosting Development Activities Meetings (D.A.M.s) to improve transparency for local projects and the members of involved neighborhoods.

What are the benefits of becoming an RCO?



- Receive notice of local projects requiring a public hearing that meet a development threshold
- Guaranteed Development Activity Meeting (D.A.M.) with project developer/applicant prior to a public hearing for projects meeting a D.A.M. threshold
- Develop Neighborhood Plans in collaboration with the DCP so that they may be adopted by the Planning Commission
- Featured on official maps, brochures, and directories as part of the City RCO network
- Become a part of a citywide network of community groups that receive resources and training from the DCP.

What is the role of RCOs in the Development Activity Meeting (D.A.M.) process?



- Notify affected residents, community members and stakeholders about upcoming D.A.M. at least 10 days prior to the meeting.
- Convene and host D.A.M. at an open, ADA accessible facility or virtually.
- Engage with applicant (developer) with meaningful feedback about the proposed project.
- Create agenda and take meeting notes for D.A.M.
- Share notes publicly with affected groups in geography.
RCOs are notified by the DCP whenever a public hearing is required for projects meeting a specific development threshold is formally submitted to the City within their geographic boundaries. If there is only one (1) affected RCO for a property, this organization coordinates with the applicant to convene the public D.A.M. at which applicants are required to attend and present their proposal at least 30 days prior to the public hearing. Where there is more than one RCO in an area, the DCP will coordinate the meeting in cooperation with all affected RCOs to convene the public meeting at which applicants are required to attend and present their proposal at least 30 days prior to the public hearing.
Individual community members and/or organizations are entitled to testify and/or to send letters to the Boards and Commissions regardless of RCO status.

Performance Point Process Guide

The Performance Points System encourages new developments to embrace innovation and contribute to neighborhood livability. Projects can earn points that increase their density by incorporating City of Pittsburgh and community priorities such as affordable housing, public art, and energy-efficient design. This points system is part of the City’s Zoning Code (Section 915.07) and is used within a number of districts as listed below and mapped. For each performance point, up to an additional fifteen (15) feet in building height is earned (up to the area’s height maximum).
Performance Points will be evaluated and approved as a component of the Zoning Application (ZDR) and the required material will be expected with the initial application material for the ZDR case in theOneStopPGHonline application portal. Applicants intending to seek Performance Points are encouraged to note that in thePre-Applicationrequest info. Some Performance Points will require a specific Pre-Application meeting and staff will schedule that accordingly.
As more process guides are developed and approved by the City, we will add them to this site.
