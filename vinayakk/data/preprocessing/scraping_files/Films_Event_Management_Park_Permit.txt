Film & Event Management

Welcome to the Office of Film & Event Management
The Office of Film & Event Management (OFEM) is the official permitting authority for block parties, special events, first amendment activity, and film projects in the City of Pittsburgh. To support the city’s rapidly growing event & film industry, the Office of Film & Event Management has streamlined the permitting process for event organizers and film producers via efficient digital permitting. In addition to streamlining the permitting process for events & film projects in the City of Pittsburgh, the Office of Film & Event Management will also be responsible for the following:


- Issuing permits to events and productions filming on public property in the City of Pittsburgh.
- Facilitating communication between event organizers, film producers, and city departments and authorities.
- Handling cost recovery efforts for City services related to event & film needs.
- Handling permitting for block-parties and community festivals in addition to special events and films.
- Consulting on major and minor civic events within the City.
OFEM is tasked with receiving and vetting applications for small and large-scale events and film productions within the City of Pittsburgh as well as consulting with both film and event permit applicants to ensure that industry standards, safety regulations, and city policies are followed and met. Via the Special Events Committee, OFEM also works with all City departments to ensure proper planning, coordination, and execution of all events and film projects. Additionally, it will ensure that events and film productions do not negatively impact the City’s operations and remain positive assets to the City and its residents.

New Permit Management System Launch!

Beginning in the spring of 2024, the Office of Film & Event Management (OFEM) launched a new permit management system, Eproval! With the launch of this new system came a new two-phase application approach to special event permitting. The new process allowed event organizers to secure their preferred venue first, and then focus on the details of the event. Previously, applicants had to wait until many details of their event were in place before they could apply. Now, applicants could secure their venue and dates, then move forward with hiring all of their vendors and performers with the comfort of knowing they had a secure venue and dates.
Please see the release below for more information on EProval, and please visit the Special Event & Block Party Permitting page for information on the new application process. Please check out the 'Getting Started: Event Permits' document under the 'Important Documents' tab on the left for information on the entire permitting process!

New Features with Eproval

In addition to being able to secure their event venue prior to completing all event-specific details, Eproval provides several new exciting features that will make the event permitting process more streamlined for applicants. Among them:
Scalable Application:During Phase Two of the application, applicants will be asked a series of yes/no questions up front, such as but not limited to: “will your event have a stage?” and “will you be having fireworks?” This allows the system to custom build an application specific to that event. If the event takes place in a park and does not impact any roadways, the applicant will not be presented with questions about road closures. If an event will not have fireworks, the applicant will not have to answer any questions about fireworks. This will minimize the length of the application for small community events, while larger more complex events will require more information.
Public Event Calendar:During the application process, applicants will be given the opportunity to opt-in to our brand new public event calendar. This will be a forward facing calendar that will list all pending and approved event applications. Applicants who opt into being on the calendar can provide contact info and website information, as well as a quick two to three sentence marketing pitch. This calendar will be available on the City’s website for anyone to find when looking for things to do in the City.

Special Event & Block Party Permitting


Eproval

With the launch of Eproval, the Office of Film & Event Management (OFEM) is instituting a new two-phase application approach to event permitting. The new process will allow event organizers to secure their preferred venue first, and then focus on the details of the event. Previously, applicants would need to wait until many details of their event were in place before they could apply. Now, applicants can secure their venue and dates, then move forward with hiring all of their vendors and performers with the comfort of knowing they have a secure venue and dates.
Note:Block Party Permit applicationsdo notfollow the two phase approach and will maintain their traditional application & approval procedures.
The new process is separated into two distinct phases:

Phase One: Reservation of Space (ROS)

The first step in securing a special event permit will now be completing and submitting the Reservation of Space application. This application will include mostly high-level details: contact info, venue, dates, times, routes (if a run/walk etc), and basic event concept information. Per City code, this ROS application can be submitted up to 180 business days before the first permitted event date (“on-site date”, i.e. when set up would begin). To submit this application, event organizers do not need to provide site maps, insurance, vendor details, or any granular information at this time. The $25 application processing fee will be charged at submission of the ROS application.
Once received, the ROS application will be reviewed by relevant stakeholders on the City’s Special Events Committee (SEC) to determine if the requested venue is available on the dates requested, that construction or other potential conflicts do not exist or can be mediated, and if resources are available to accommodate the event. Should all these conditions be met, the ROS application will be approved. At this time, OFEM will approve the ROS application and release to the applicant Phase Two of the Special Event Permit application, and the applicant can move forward with procuring all the necessary amenities for their event knowing their venue and dates are secure. Please note, an approval of the ROS application isnota full approval to proceed with the event, it merely commits the venue to the event. Full approval does not occur until Phase Two of the application is complete.

Phase Two: Special Event Application

Upon approval of the ROS application, Phase Two of the application will be released to the applicant. It is at this time that all remaining relevant details of the event must be provided. These details include site maps, insurance, specific event timelines, any Public Safety needs, needed City resources, and entertainment information, among other things. The Phase Two application can be submitted whenever complete, but will be due to OFEM no later than fourteen (14) business days prior to the on-site date. Once submitted, the Phase Two application will be reviewed by the SEC. If there are issues with the Phase Two application during review, the application will follow the current process of OFEM working with the applicant to resolve any outstanding concerns and endeavor to get the application to an approvable state. If approved, the applicant will receive their permit and invoice for any relevant charges, including the permit fee. It is at this time the event will be considered fully approved and permitted.

Block Party Permits

A "block party" means a one-day outdoor public event organized by the residents of a City block and held upon a City right-of-way for social or entertainment purposes. Block Party permits are limited to “Residential” districts as defined in the Zoning Code and limited to one (1) city block. The activities that take place at a block party are up to the imagination of the residents and can include casual conversation, cook outs, pot luck dinners, games for children, and/or entertainment. Block parties are designed to take place in the street and on the sidewalks of the requested block. To enhance the sense of community, the City allows the street to be closed to traffic. In addition, having a Block Party Permit provides an exemption from some portions of the City’s noise ordinance, thus allowing you to play music using amplifiers that would otherwise be prohibited in public. Finally, Block Party Permits are exempt from the City’s “Open Container” law, thus allowing public consumption of alcohol by attendees of legal age at an approved block party, only on the block identified by the permit.
Block Party Permit applications must be submitted at least seven (7) business days prior to the event date to ensure proper time for review. Additionally, block party permits can only be written for weekends and federal holidays, and are only valid between the hours of 10:00am and 10:00pm. While not a federal holiday, block party permits can be issued for Halloween as a means for creating safe trick or treating environments in neighborhoods. All other conditions of a block party permit must still be met for those occurring on Halloween.
Lastly, Block party permits cannot be issued for private events, including but not limited to: wedding receptions, birthday parties, graduations or family reunions. Block Party permits also cannot be issued to create venues for artist markets, farmers markets, or other for-profit ventures. These events can apply for Special Event Permits per the conditions of those permits.
NOTE: Block Party permits are not subject to the above two-phase application process and remain a single submission application.
Please note: both Phase One and Phase Two of an event application must be completed no later than 14 business days before the on-site time. Please allow yourself enough time for both phases of the application to be approved at least 14 days before your event.
To begin your application process, please click below to launch Eproval.

Special Events Committee

Once a Reservation of Space application is received and logged, it moves on to the vetting process via the Special Events Committee. The Special Events Committee is a group of representatives from various City departments, including but not limited to Public Safety, Public Works, Parks & Recreation, Emergency Management, and Pittsburgh Regional Transit. This group meets every Tuesday morning to discuss the applications received the previous week, and to continue discussion on any applications that have been held over from the previous week. Once the Reservation of Space application is approved and an applicant has received, completed, and submitted their Phase Two Special Event application, the members of the SEC will review the Phase Two application in the same manner, leading to a full approval of an application.
The job of this committee is to review each application and determine if the proposed event is viable, make sure the dates and locations requested are available, ensure that proper procedure is being followed, and that any needed City resources are properly allocated and not over-booked.
If necessary, the committee may request that an organizer attend a committee meeting to further discuss their proposed event, and to work one-on-one with department representatives to iron out any needs from the respective departments.

The members of the Special Events Committee are as follows.

Frequently Asked Questions


General Questions


What City facilities are available to rent online?

Most park shelters are available to rent online. Certain park shelters may not be available to rent if they are closed for maintenance or an open space that is not rented. Many of our shelters are open from the beginning of May through the 2nd week of October (weather permitting), while others are open year round (please refer to shelter info by clicking "View Facilities" selecting a park by clicking the name of park, and clicking "Info" box). Amenities can also be found in this section.
For inquiries regarding the Mellon Park Walled Garden, the Mount Washington Overlooks, sports fields, or a particular facility you cannot find, please emaildpwfields&parkshelters@pittsburghpa.gov. These facilities cannot be booked directly online.

Can I still rent facilities in person at the Public Works Permit Office?

At this time, in additional to online reservations, phone or person park shelter reservations will be done by appointment only. Please emailAllison.Botti@pittsburghpa.govto setup an appointment during the hours of 7:00 AM - 3:00 PM Monday - Friday. Email is preferred, but you can also call 412-255-2366.

The building has elevator access.

I tried to create a new account online but I get a message that my email is already in the system. What should I do?

If you have rented a shelter from the City before, there's a chance we may already have your email address in our system. In this case, click the 'Sign In" button at the top of the screen then use the "Reset Password" link on the Login Page to reset your password. You will then be able to log into your account and proceed with the online rental process. If you experience any further issues, please contact our office.

Payment Questions


What payment options will the City accept for rental of City facilities?

For online rentals, available payment methods include credit or debit transactions using Visa, MasterCard, or Discover. Those paying with a credit or debit card will incur a 2% + $0.25 service fee. These fees are charged by the City's payment processor, JetPay, for all transactions. For those paying in person at the Department of Public Works Permit Office, the City will also accept money orders and business checks in addition to the payment options listed above for online transactions. Checks/money orders should be made out to "Treasurer, City of Pittsburgh." Please note that the service fees for credit/debit cards apply for those renting at the Permit Office as well as those renting online. Cash will not be accepted.

Why am I being charged a service fee for the use of a credit card?

The City of Pittsburgh contracts with JetPay to provide the convenience of credit and debit transactions for a variety of City services. These fees are charged by JetPay as part of processing payments on behalf of the City. In addition, the City still accepts money orders and business checks if rentals are made at the Public Works Permit Office. Checks/money orders should be made out to "Treasurer, City of Pittsburgh."

Park Shelter Permitting Questions


What is the process for renting a shelter online?

Citizens who wish to rent a shelter online will first need to navigate https://registerparks.pittsburghpa.gov and create a new account. Once a new account has been created, users can search for available shelters, complete required rental information, and reserve a shelter.
Please note that if the date shows up as "conflict" this means that the shelter is under a seasonal closure or it is already booked by someone else. You may find the "Facility Calendar" option on our website useful, which shows what shelters and dates are already booked.

When is the shelter available for me to use on the day of my event?

Most shelter permits are valid from 11:00 AM - 9:00 PM on the day of your event. Please note that some weekday rentals are valid only from 1:00 PM - 9:00 PM to accommodate CitiParks programming in certain locations. If you need time to prepare for your event, please plan accordingly since access to the shelter prior to the start date and time specified is non-negotiable. Similarly, the facility must be cleaned and vacated prior to the 9:00 PM end time.

What if I only need to rent a shelter for several hours? Can I get a reduced permit fee since I won't be using the shelter for the entire day?

All rentals are for the standard time period. Public Works schedules park employees to clean shelters to ensure they are ready for all rentals at the designated start time. However, we are only able to accommodate one rental for each shelter on a given day. As a result, the full permit fee applies regardless of whether you will be using the shelter for the full time period or only for a portion of the day.

Does a separate permit need to be obtained to have alcohol at my event?

As of early 2019, all shelter fees include an alcohol permit. No additional payment or permit is needed. Please note while alcohol consumption is permitted, alcohol sales are prohibited without proper permitting. If you have any questions, please contact our office.

I cannot find the permit that was emailed to me. Is there a way for me to get a copy of my permit?

Yes, first login to your account athttps://registerparks.pittsburghpa.gov. Click the "My Account" link and then click on the "Rentals" link located under the "History" section of the "My Account" page to view all of your facility rental permits. From this page you can either email or print a copy of the permit.

How far in advance am I able to rent a shelter?

Shelters are available for rent up to 365 days in advance on a rolling basis. All shelter rentals are available on a first come first serve basis. Shelter rentals must be completed at least four (4) days before your selected date; after this time, the shelter will no longer be available to rent online. If you wish to rent an available shelter but the four (4) day deadline has passed, please contact the Public Works Permit Office to see if it is still possible to get a permit for the shelter.

Will the City refund my permit fee if my plans change?

The City will provide a refund if we receive cancellation notice at least thirty (30) days in advance of your permitted date. In these instances, the City retains a $10.00 processing fee but will refund all other fees associated with the rental. Once it is less than 30 days until your permitted date, we are unable to refund or transfer your permit to a new location or date.No permit fee shall be returned and no changes shall be made unless DPW receives a dated email or written request of cancellation or changes at least thirty (30) days prior to the date of the permit- weather is not considered a valid reason for cancellation or change of shelter/date location.

In what case would I need insurance for a shelter rental?

The permits issued entitles the permit holder to use the shelter and the grounds identified in the permit. If additional activities are planned (i.e.: inflatable bounce house, tent, etc.) the permit holder must provide a Certificate of Liability Insurance naming the City of Pittsburgh Department of Public Works as an additional insured.See a sample certificate of insurance.(PDF, 3MB)

What if I have a question about the shelter I rented on the day of my reservation?

Much of the information a permit holder needs to know is within the permit received. However, if you have additional questions or concerns, please emaildpwfields&parkshelters@pittsburghpa.gov. Email is preferred, but you may also call 412-742-3413 during our normal office hours Monday - Friday, 7AM - 3PM. If your permit is not during these hours, please call 412-670-4185.

Why am I required to submit a request to rent a room in a senior center or community center before I can pay for the rental and receive my permit?
