Pittsburgh


Transitions

Pittsburgh was founded on November 25, 1758. Early on, Pittsburgh played an important role in our country’s history. In the early 1800s, the city became known as the “Gateway to the West.” This nickname referenced the huge advantage Pittsburgh had by having the intersection of three major waterways. The Allegheny River and Monongahela River join together at what is known as the “point” to form the Ohio River. This intersection opened the gates for Pittsburgh to lead the way in the trade industry for products such as coal, timber, natural gas, iron and limestone. By 1911, Pittsburgh manufactured half of the nation’s steel. Due to the amount of pollution given off by the steel factories the city had a new nickname - “The Smoky City."
Throughout the years, Pittsburgh has made multiple changes and overcome many obstacles. The city has moved from the steel industry to healthcare, education, technology, and financial services. What were once heavily polluted streets are now clear due to the restrictions on factories. Companies such as Google, RAND, PNC and Highmark have emerged and are now calling Pittsburgh home.

Population Statistics

Pennsylvania is the sixth largest populated state in the United States. Pittsburgh is the second largest city in Pennsylvania and has an estimated of 310,000 people. The population consists of 51.9% females and 48.9% males, with the average age being 33.


- Caucasian = 66%
- African American = 26%
- Asian = 4%
- Hispanic = 2%

Community

The City of Pittsburgh offers everything a person might be looking for in a home, with its wonderful shopping areas, great restaurants, and beautiful views. The Strip District is a wonderful market spot known for its variety of food and an excellent shopping with unique stores. The neighborhood known as Shadyside is another fantastic region of Pittsburgh to find trendy shops and restaurants. If you’re looking for authentic homemade Italian food, Bloomfield or “Pittsburgh’s Little Italy” is the place for you.

East Liberty is known as for business and industries. Looking for a fun night out on the town? Southside has a fun and exciting nightlife full of clubs, sports bars, and laid back pubs. Wanting to catch a game or spend some quality time with your loved ones? The North Shore or North Side is the place to be. Mt.

Finally, Downtown, like most downtown districts, has great food, dining, parks, plazas, and art museums.
