Mobility and Infrastructure


Our Mission

Provide the physical mobility necessary to support the social and economic mobility of the people of Pittsburgh through the management, design, improvement, and operation of the public right of way.

What We Do

The Department is responsible for the transportation of people and goods throughout the City of Pittsburgh, and for managing the operation of and access to the public right-of-way (the sidewalks, curbs, streets, and bridges that make up our network).

City's Mobility Principles



- No one dies or is seriously injured traveling on city streets.
- Every household in Pittsburgh can access fresh fruits and vegetables within 20 minutes travel of home, without the requirement of a private vehicle.
- All trips less than 1 mile are easily and enjoyably achieved by non-vehicle travel.
- No household must spend more than 45% of household income to satisfy basic housing, transportation and energy needs.
- The design, maintenance and operation of city streets reflects the values of our community.
Research finds thataccess to transportationis the factor most likely to influence household economic success. With this in mind, the mission of the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure is to provide the transportation mobility essential to the economic mobility of all Pittsburghers.

COVID-19 Response

The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly altered life in Pittsburgh. Businesses have shut down and services have been limited, job and housing stability have become uncertain, and education, worship, and healthcare have shifted to operating virtually. In response, cities, including Pittsburgh, have adapted in ways that will allow life and business to resume with some level of vitality under new and necessary constraints.

PGH Streets and Mobility Task Force

The Pittsburgh Streets and Mobility Task Force was formed to explore ways in which we can redesign our city streets and reconceive transportation and mobility in order to best support businesses and residents to stabilize and strengthen the local economy and serve the mental and physical health of our people. See thereport from the Task Force(PDF, 4MB).
If you are a business owner, please take a moment to respond to ourCOVID-19 Small Business Survey. Your input will help us to implement and adapt policies to support local businesses.

Micromobility Guidance

Electric powered micromobility devices are an emerging form of urban mobility. Ownership and use of these devices have grown exponentially in the City of Pittsburgh over the past many months. The City does not wish to penalize people who use these devices in a safe and responsible manner yet the lack of guidance makes enforcement against dangerous or irresponsible use challenging.
This Guidance provides a local definition of powered micromobility devices and defines appropriate operation and use in the City of Pittsburgh with the intent to promote safe and harmonious operations in the public right of way.

The City of Pittsburgh owns 143 active bridges that span and climb our uneven terrain of rivers, runs, and valleys. These structures safely and efficiently connect 90 distinct neighborhoods into one unified community that we live, work, and play in. Their unrivaled scale, variety, and history are recognized worldwide and have proudly earned us our status as “The City of Bridges.”
Our bridges link us back to our industrial heritage while enabling transportation for millions of people and goods traveling today. Whether they cross a secluded park trail or the banks of the Monongahela River, each has a unique design and purpose. The Department of Mobility and Infrastructure is responsible for city bridge improvement and maintenance and works to ensure that all of our assets continue to support the mobility needs of Pittsburgh well into the future.
Visit our City Bridge Dashboard to learn more about each bridge, including information and links to upcoming projects:

FAQ:

Who should I contact if I want to report a safety or maintenance concern?



- For any immediate, urgent emergencies, please first call 9-1-1.
- For all other concerns, please contact us through calling 3-1-1 or submitting a requestonline(If submitting online, select “Bridge Maintenance” as the Request Type.) DOMI reviews all submitted requests concerning the public right-of-way and its associated infrastructure.

How does the city prioritize which bridges to repair? Which bridges are being repaired now?



- DOMI uses a wide range of criteria when evaluating and prioritizing bridge improvements. Our first goal is always maintaining public safety, and we respond to urgent needs as identified by our personnel or inspections.
- Large scale rehabilitation or replacement projects are judged by factors including estimated remaining life, traffic volumes, truck and emergency vehicle usage, potential detour lengths, proximity to public services, available funding eligibility, and others.
- Besides the City Bridges Dashboard, you can also check theDOMI Project Mapto see ongoing projects from across the department and theCity’s EngagePGH pageto keep up with updates and provide input on upcoming projects.

Where does the funding for bridge projects come from?



- Bridge funding comes from a variety of places. Most large projects are eligible for and receive a majority of their total cost from federal, state, private, or other investments routed through Transportation Improvement Programs (TIP), coordinated by the Southwestern Pennsylvania Commission (SPC). Others receive the backing of unique grants, such as the American Rescue Plan (ARP), passed federally in 2021. Local, or city, contributions cover most routine maintenance and other priorities that don’t match with outside sources.
- DOMI funding, along with all other city departments, is split between operating, or day-to-day, and capital, or major projects, budgets. It is authorized annually following input from the City’s Office of Management and Budget, the Mayor, community outreach, and final approval from the City Council. You can learn more about the City’s budget process and how to weigh in here atEngagePGH.

Why does it take so long to repair bridges?



- Outside of emergency work, typical federally-funded projects can take upwards of five years to progress from initial project planning through engineering. The process must pass through state and federal oversight and follow their respective design and project development requirements.
- Bridge projects involve frequent coordination with a varied set of stakeholders, including regional, state, and federal partners, utility companies, adjacent residents and property owners, and other city services.
- DOMI is currently managing over a dozen major rehabilitation projects in phases ranging from preliminary engineering to construction, while also with keeping up with small repairs and maintenance of many more. This requires careful prioritization to best manage resources and staff capacity, along with that of our consultants and contractors. Shortening project timelines would limit the number of concurrent projects that we could process simultaneously.
- Many of our city bridges are recognized as individually eligible or are listed as contributing resources in the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP). Rehabilitation of these structures requires more robust analysis in order to maintain their historic character. While we are fortunate to have these distinguished assets connecting us to our past, they were often designed for lighter vehicles or with different principles than newer bridges are today. This adds some complexity as we work to update and modernize our inventory to better serve the public.

Why did the Fern Hollow Bridge collapse? What changes have been made since then?



- In January 2022, the Fern Hollow Bridge carrying Forbes Avenue over Frick Park experienced structural failure and fell into the valley below. You can read about the National Transportation Safety Board’s findings into the probable causes, along with their safety recommendations to the City of Pittsburgh and other stakeholders here:https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/Pages/HWY22MH003.aspx


    * https://www.ntsb.gov/investigations/Pages/HWY22MH003.aspx
- In response, the City of Pittsburgh later that year released the comprehensive Bridge Asset Management Report, the largest analysis of our bridge inventory in our city’s history. City staff, outside experts, and consulting engineering firms reviewed all bridge inspection reports, conducted new on-site inspections, developed new priority repairs, revised procurement and contract policies, and connected with new funding sources.
- The City has since kicked off a new Bridge Asset Management Program. We have increased our bridge personnel and created a new, dedicated Bridge Maintenance Division. In 2023, we were proud to address more bridge maintenance than we had during the previous three years combined. We’re continuing to reduce the number of poorly rated bridges through ongoing and planned repairs and rehabilitations.
- PennDOT, in partnership with DOMI, designed and constructed the new Fern Hollow Bridge with federal funds made available by the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. The bridge fully opened to traffic in 2023; read more about the project here:https://www.penndot.pa.gov/RegionalOffices/district-11/ConstructionsProjectsAndRoadwork/AlleghenyCountyConstruction/Pages/FernHollowBridgeProject.aspx

- Read more about all of these changes and see the full reports here:Bridge Asset Management Program

How does the inspection process work? How often are bridges inspected?



- Routine bridge inspections help to maintain safe travel, prevent structural failures, and enable better asset management planning and stewardship of public investments. Inspection requirements and format are set by the National Bridge Inspection Standards (NBIS), published by the Federal Highway Administration and last updated in 2022. All bridge inspectors are certified by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT) by completing a Bridge Safety Inspector Training and Certification program and biennial training courses.
- Inspectors make visual and physical observations of all components of a bridge, including the deck, superstructure, substructure, channel, signage, and approaches. Inspections highlight deterioration and note any changes over time, comparing the current state to the original as-built condition.
- After making evaluations, inspectors publish an inspection report that assigns component ratings and recommends repairs. Structural engineers then use these reports to program required maintenance, calculate weight limits as needed, and plan future projects.
- Every city vehicle bridge with spanning 20 feet or greater is inspected at least every two years. City pedestrian bridges and vehicle bridges spanning 8 to 20 feet are inspected at least every five years. Bridges with specific needs are inspected more frequently, typically at either six-month or annual intervals.
- Read more about the NBIS and bridge inspections:https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bridge/inspection/


    * https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bridge/inspection/

How often are bridges maintained? What maintenance is the city doing now?



- DOMI is always monitoring the conditions of city bridges. Common routine tasks include cleaning and washing bridges and drainage systems, replacing expansion joints and seals, patching areas of concrete deterioration, replacing barriers and curbs, clearing debris, painting, and resurfacing roadways. Proactive maintenance and upkeep protects the public’s investment by reducing the need for more expensive improvements as a bridge’s condition worsens.
- Larger-scale projects include bridge preservation, rehabilitation, and replacement. Preservation aims to extend a bridge’s useful life by preventing or reducing deterioration. Rehabilitations restore a select set of components to address specific issues. Full structural replacement is reserved for when other repairs are impractical or infeasible.

What does a poor rating mean? Is it still safe to travel across or under poorly rated bridges?



- Every bridge inspection assigns condition ratings for each of the deck, superstructure, substructure, and culvert components. As defined by the National Bridge Inspection Standards (NBIS), these ratings scale from nine to zero:
- 9 – Excellent
- 8 – Very Good
- 7 – Good
- 6 – Satisfactory
- 5 – Fair
- 4 – Poor
- 3 – Serious
- 2 – Critical
- 1 – Imminent Failure
- 0 – Failed


- The lowest component condition rating determines the overall rating classification for a bridge:9 to 7 – Good Condition6 to 5 – Fair Condition4 or Lower – Poor Condition


    * 9 to 7 – Good Condition
    * 6 to 5 – Fair Condition
    * 4 or Lower – Poor Condition


- While condition ratings are an important summary, they can sometimes be limited in describing an individual bridge’s status. The full picture of a bridge’s health also depends on other factors such as structure type, size, material composition, usage, and location. Two bridges with the same rating may require very different levels or types of maintenance to remain in service.
- Poorly rated bridges are not immediately unsafe to travel on or at risk of failure. The rating signifies that the structural components have started to lose strength due to defects, and that action is needed to prevent further deterioration. This can often be remedied by repairs, restrictions, or by redundancies in the design of the structure. Engineers determine if a bridge is safe to remain open after conducting a load rating analysis and assessing the bridge’s weight limit. If the weight limit is below the safe load for vehicles and repairs are not possible or practical, the bridge will be closed. Safety is DOMI’s highest priority, and caution is taken to ensure that no one is ever at risk.

What does a weight limit mean? Is it still safe to travel across or under load-posted bridges?



- A weight limit is a legally enforceable posting, indicated by signage, restricting the maximum vehicle load, or weight, allowed on a road or bridge. This is determined by a load rating analysis, taking into account the bridge’s structural design, various vehicle configurations, any reductions in the bridge’s capacity due to damage or deterioration, and uncertainty.
- It is the responsibility of the bridge owner to post and update weight limits as needed. After every bridge inspection, engineers determine if an updated load rating analysis is necessary based on observed changes since the previous inspection.
- Vehicles weighing less than the posted limit can safely cross a bridge. Weight limits are put in place to protect the public and extend the service life of a bridge. If the weight limit is low enough to be a risk to public safety, the bridge will be closed to all traffic or removed.
- Weight limits are related to, but not completely dependent on condition ratings. Older bridges were often originally designed for much lighter vehicle loads than are common and legal today. Some structures can be in fair or good condition but restricted to a lower weight limit if no modifications have been made.

Which bridges are owned by the city? Who do I contact about non-city owned bridges?

The City of Pittsburgh does not own every bridge within the city limits. Many are owned by Allegheny County, Pittsburgh Regional Transit, the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation (PennDOT), or private entities such as railroads. Check the links to report safety or maintenance issues and for more information.

Bike(+) Plan

Updated June 2020
Bike(+) Plan June 2020(PDF, 66MB)
The plan lays out a vision for a safe and connected network of on-street and off street facilities that will enable people of all ages and abilities to travel by bicycle and other small mobility modes to access the needs of daily life including grocery stores, parks, schools, and places of employment. The ten-year plan aims to increase safety and access, expand affordable travel choices, and provide attractive alternatives for short-distance vehicle travel to reduce traffic congestion and associated emissions.
Branded the Bike “Plus” Plan, the strategy is not only proactive with regard to emerging forms of mobility such as pedal-assist electric bicycles, motorized scooter and skateboards and other individual mobility modes that may emerge over the next decade; but is additive beyond mere mobility.
The plan is a critical step in meeting city climate goals to reduce transportation-related emissions 50% by 2030 while at the same time expanding affordable access to jobs and destinations.

City Steps


Pittsburgh City Steps

Pittsburgh has more public staircases than any city in the United States. The City’s steps connect communities and provide residents access to transit and other amenities. Nearly two-thirds of the steps are in low or moderate-income areas. They are critical assets in the City’s pedestrian transportation network and beyond.
Pittsburgh City Steps Map
Maintaining the large inventory of sets of steps is an enormous challenge. Approximately 460 sets of steps are built on structures, while others are built into sidewalks, known as “jumperwalks.” Repairing or replacing an on-structure staircase is a logistical, design, and construction undertaking comparable to a small bridge project. As a result, the rehabilitation or replacement of a run of steps requires detailed planning and design which can take several years to complete prior to the start of construction. There is a need to study and prioritize these investments to make the most impact for people walking in Pittsburgh’s neighborhoods.
For more information about current Steps projects please see ourDOMI Project Map.

Steps Assessment

In 2017 through 2018 the City of Pittsburgh developed a systematic method for prioritizing which sets of steps should be repaired and rebuilt. The City used spatial analysis, public input, and field visits to create a prioritized list of steps, which ultimately will help inform locations of step-related projects for rehabilitation and renovation. The City also reviewed public step maintenance and repair best practices from other U.S. cities and developed guidance about step materials and design. This prioritization process was completed as part of Pittsburgh’s participation in the City Accelerator program, an initiative of Living Cities and the Citi Foundation. See the full report for the complete findings summary.

Neighborways

Neighborways are low-traffic streets that prioritize pedestrians, bicyclists, and other non-vehicular traffic and offer a safer, more comfortable alternative to busy arterial streets. Neighborways typically run through residential neighborhoods and use context-appropriate traffic calming tools to keep speeds slow and safe for all users. They aim to connect neighborhoods and feature clear signs and pavement markings to help people easily navigate through Pittsburgh. Neighborways have been implemented across the city as a part of the MoveForward Program.
Through theBike+ Plan, the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure has identified streets on the Bike+ network that meet the thresholds to be a Neighborway. These streets contribute to connections in the Bike+ Plan, but do not require dedicated bike lanes. Neighborways have minimal implications to existing on-street parking.
To be considered to become a Neighborway, streets must:


- be owned by the City of Pittsburgh
- have a maximum of two travel lanes
- have a speed limit of 25 miles per hour
- have maximum vehicle volumes of 3,000 vehicles per day
The traffic calming tools for each Neighborway are informed by data collection, street context, engineers’ judgement, and supplemental community input.
Pittsburgh’s first Neighborway was established in the South Side Flats.
Photo: Graph showing volume of traffic vs. speed and what type of bike infrastructure treatment is suggested. Photo is taken from the Bike(+) Plan.

Neighborway Toolkit

Like the streets and neighborhoods of Pittsburgh, every Neighborway is different. To achieve our goals of reducing speeds and increasing safety for all users, each block and intersection along the route may require different design solutions. These designs respond to the local conditions of the route. For example, a neighborhood street with excessive motorist speeds may get speed humps. A four-way, stop-controlled intersection may get a traffic circle to reduce the rate of vehicular collisions while modifying how different modes interact through the intersection.

Wayfinding Signage & Shared-Lane Markings

Neighborways will be easy to identify and navigate because of signage and pavement markings throughout the corridor. Shared-lane pavement markings, otherwise known as “sharrows”, will guide bicyclists through the corridor and remind motorists to share the road.
Left:A sharrow on the Central Lawrenceville Neighborway. Bi-directional sharrows like the one above are only used on narrow yield streets.Right:Neighborway signage included along each corridor.

Curb Extensions / Bump Outs

Using concrete, pavement markings, and/or vertical elements, curb extensions (also referred to as bump outs) reinforce the distance from an intersection where parking is not allowed, increasing safety and visibility for all modes in our roads’ most dangerous areas - the intersections. In the State of Pennsylvania, it is illegal to park with 30 feet of a stop sign or traffic signal, or within 20 feet of a marked or unmarked crosswalk at an intersection. Keeping this space clear is important to preserve sightlines for all users approaching an intersection.

Neighborhood Traffic Circles

Neighborhood traffic circles are a tool best suited for streets with moderate speeding problems (generally, this means 85th percentile speeds fall below 30 mph) and concerns around intersection safety. They are an improvement to an existing four-way stop controlled intersection and feature a concrete circle at the center of the intersection. This circle prevents bicyclists and motorists from traveling straight through the intersection. Instead, they must slowly turn right around the circle until they exit the intersection. This turning movement improves safety by encouraging slower speeds and reduces the number potential conflict points. According to the Federal Highway Administration, traffic circles installed along a corridor are proven to reduce prevailing speeds 4-6 miles per hour. One case study in Seattle, WA saw a 94% reduction in crashes and a 99% reduction in injuries after installing their first neighborhood traffic circles in 1991.

Speed Humps

Wider and less abrupt than the more commonly known speed bumps, speed humps encourage slower speeds and discourage unnecessary non-local traffic. They are designed to be comfortable for all modes to travel over when taken at appropriate speeds. This traffic calming tool is reserved for Neighborways with severe speeding, and also must have appropriate grades (less than 8%). Speed humps can be installed on roads that are not on the Bike+ Plan as part of DOMI’sTraffic Calming Program.

Critical Gap Solutions

Sometimes there are opportunities to connect Neighborways for bicyclists and pedestrians with ramps, trails, stairways with runnels, and other creative solutions. An example of this is the shared-use ramp that was installed in the South Side Neighborway underneath the Birmingham Bridge.

Pedestrian Safety Action Plan

Updated June 2022
The City of Pittsburgh’s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) is proud to release and implement the city's first Pedestrian Safety Action Plan.
Founded over 250 years ago, Pittsburgh was originally designed to be navigated on foot with sidewalks, pedestrian paths, and public steps connecting neighborhoods to schools and employment destinations. Many neighborhoods are within walking distance of main street business districts with varied and often historic buildings providing interest along the route. Pittsburgh’s history as a walking city influences the way people get around today. Pittsburgh has one of the highest rates of commuting on foot in the country and is one of the least-dependent on cars for commuting (U.S. Census, 2008-2012 and BikePGH, 2016).
Pedestrian Safety Action Plan(PDF, 116MB)
According to Director Karina Ricks, “This Plan is a roadmap that provides a holistic approach for implementation of strategies and actions to improve safety and access for people walking in the city.”

Goals of the Plan

The goal of the Pedestrian Safety Action Plan is to identify policy and infrastructure improvements that support the City’s mobility goals:


- Goal 1: No one dies or is seriously injured traveling on city streets (streets and intersections are intuitive to use, even by an adolescent child).
- Goal 2: Every resident can access fresh fruits and vegetables within 20 minutes travel of home (without requiring a private vehicle).
- Goal 3: All trips less than 1 mile are easy and enjoyable to achieve by non-automobile travel.
- Goal 4: No household must spend more than 45% of income on housing + transportation + energy (for any income quintile).
- Goal 5: Our streets reflect the values and pride of our city.
To achieve DOMI’s goals, this Plan must define actionable steps toward a future where:


- Step 1: People are safe walking day or night an in all neighborhoods.
- Step 2: Pittsburgh has a pedestrian network that is accessible and intuitive for everyone.
- Step 3: Kids can safely walk around Pittsburgh.
- Step 4: Pittsburgh’s pedestrian network is connected to other modes.
- Step 5: Walking supports community mental and physical health, well-being, and connections.
This Plan was developed through a collaborative effort by the Pittsburgh Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI), the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), and a core group of local stakeholders. Based on a detailed analysis of local crash data, it identifies:
- Critical pedestrian safety issues
- Locations with a higher risk for pedestrian crashes
- Specific actions that DOMI will undertake
- Metrics for monitoring performance over time

Haiku Safety Program – Poetry and Art Contest

DOMI is also excited to announce the Haiku Safety Program Poetry and Art Contest. This public art installation uses colorful, temporary signs and poetry made by submissions from Pittsburgh residents to underscore the important message of sharing the streets safely with pedestrians, bicyclists, and motorists.
Pittsburgh residents are invited to submit their transportation themed haikus and art to the contest website from May 28 - June 13, 2021. Winners will receive a prize bag and the top Haiku(s) will be transformed into signs and installed at high traffic intersections, or near cultural institutions and schools to draw attention to transportation safety.

Pedestrian Wayfinding Kiosk Project

Upcoming Events:Public Meeting (Meeting Flyer(PDF, 950KB))Cathedral of Learning, 4200 Fifth AvenueAugust 28thAfternoon Session: 3:00 to 4:00 pmEvening Session: 6:00 to 7:00 pm
Come and see the proposed kiosk designs in person, and try out the virtual reality system our partners at City Planning will have on-hand--you can visualize any location in the City and give us feedback on the best locations and content for the kiosks that would help people navigate the neighborhood.
The City of Pittsburgh is working with a Wayfinding Advisory Committee to establish new standards for pedestrian-oriented wayfinding signage. The first phase will consist of kiosks with maps and directional information, to be installed in Downtown, Oakland, and the lower North Side. These first implementation locations were selected due to the high concentration of regional destinations--the intent is to set the new design standard and then expand to other neighborhoods across the City.
The Wayfinding Advisory Committee is made up of representatives from the City, Pittsburgh Downtown Partnership, Oakland Business Improvement District, Oakland Transportation Management Association, Northside Now, the Southwestern PA Commission, and the University of Pittsburgh.
The project has been through numerous phases, with input from a large and diverse group of stakeholders at each one. The project began in late 2014, establishing a vision and collecting data on destinations across the project area. The second phase refined the destinations to be included in the signage system, and developed a strategy for implementation. The third phase drafted sign messaging and initial schematic designs. The current phase, which is close to wrapping up, involved completing the design of the kiosks.
For more background on the design and history of this project, check out the presentation the Wayfinding Advisory Committee gave to the Pittsburgh Art Commission in June 2018:

Plan Summary

The 2070 Mobility Vision Plan dares to dream. It reaches both forward and back, integrating numerous separate community-led plans, existing assets, and past wisdom into one cohesive vision for infrastructure and mobility.
It is bold – proposing policies, projects, and processes to address the imperatives of our time: equity, climate, and economic growth. And it is achievable – strategically targeting investments over time to build a future in which all, and the planet, can thrive.
More than most cities, transportation infrastructure defines Pittsburgh’s iconic image. The bridges, inclines, and public steps are part of the City’s DNA and constant reminders of the tenacity and innovation that built and sustain it. Infrastructure can also divide as neighborhoods are cleaved by highways and struggle to reconnect to opportunity. Legacy infrastructure, the scale of which is both enormous and complex, of a once-wealthy city is deteriorating with deferred maintenance and in some locations struggling to maintain its footing in the face of more and severe climate events. Pittsburgh has changed a lot over the last fifty years and change over the next fifty will be equally profound.
2020 was a difficult year. Changing travel during the COVID-19 pandemic, demonstrations against racial injustice, and dramatic environmental catastrophes resulting from climate change cast fresh light on the goals and imperatives of this Plan and a clearer lens through which to see the policies, projects, and processes contained within.
The result is a vision that is responsive to the needs and objectives of today yet flexible enough to adapt to the unknowable future. This Plan serves as a strategic roadmap to maintain past investments, address current disparities, and meet future mobility challenges. It is a long-range framework to connect our people and neighborhoods to each other, the region, and the world. It pursues the ambitious mission to provide all users the physical mobility they need to reach the economic mobility they seek. It charts a course to make small incremental progress to achieve large scale change and improvement. Through specific policy, project, and process recommendations, the Plan will move Pittsburgh closer to core goals that also align with foundational values.

Capturing the Communal Vision

Over the past fifty years there have been a lot of plans. From ambitious, almost science fiction visions of sky buses and magnetic trains to local neighborhood plans for safe crossings and better streets. Network plans, area plans, corridor plans, project plans – this Plan is a compilation of individual plans into a holistic and legible system.
The project team reviewed dozens of recent and past plans, scoured city archives and news feeds, and mined the collective wisdom of residents and stakeholders – drawing out policies, projects, and processes vital to inform this Vision. From May 2019 to January 2020, stakeholders and residents brought forward more ideas – some new, some old – through more than 900 individual comments and points of input. Participants reviewed a consolidated draft project list during a series of virtual meetings in June 2020. The graphics below show ideas that were captured during just some of those events.

Vision

The Strip District Mobility Plan envisions a transportation network that supports existing businesses and sustains growth by maximizing the use of limited space for safe, enjoyable multimodal travel.

Purpose and Need

To support this vision, the Plan process evaluated existing and projected land use and travel patterns to identify a series of recommendations to improve access, safety, and comfort for all users of the transportation network to, through, and within the Strip District.
This Plan, which was initiated by the City of Pittsburgh’s Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI), is necessary to guide and improve the neighborhood’s transportation network in such a way that balances the needs of existing businesses, new residential and economic activity, and anticipated future development. Land use patterns in the Strip District have changed considerably over the past five to 10 years; a trend that is most certainly expected to continue for the next decade. Some of this development will be sited on land that is privately owned and currently used as surface parking. The introduction of higher density land use presents numerous opportunities but may challenge Strip District residents, visitors, employers, and employees if enhancements to support more multimodal trips are not made and a shared parking strategy to absorb the demand created by new development and the removal of existing parking spaces is not advanced. New economic activity coupled with enhanced transportation options, including an intuitive publicly available parking system, will help long standing businesses maintain their livelihood and support overall neighborhood health and well-being.
In such a diverse and growing neighborhood, there is no one-size-fits-all solution. DOMI has five goals for travel in Pittsburgh; the Plan seeks to elevate travel in the Strip District closer to those goals. The Plan focuses on the next decade with the understanding that while short-term improvements are necessary, the Strip District's needs will continue to evolve. To preserve existing character and to help support existing and future residents, visitors, businesses, and employees, this Plan was charged with five objectives that guided the planning process and the recommendations contained within this document. They are:


- Objective 1:Develop an efficient and inclusive mobility network that accommodates movement for all users, abilities, and modes.
- Objective 2:Improve access to parking for employees, residents, and visitors to the Strip District.
- Objective 3:Identify an east-west bicycle connection.
- Objective 4:Explore options to pilot curbside management strategies that support the dynamic needs of a growing district.
- Objective 5:Identify an approach to ensure the successful implementation, management, and monitoring of implemented recommendations.
Figure 1: Proposed 10 year Multimodal Network
To gain a comprehensive understanding of existing and future conditions to inform recommendations, the Project Team
- Gathered traffic and parking data
- Reviewed existing data and plans
- Conducted public and stakeholder outreach
- Analyzed potential impacts associated with anticipated future growth
Findings from these efforts, coordination with City staff, and insight from subject-matter experts informed a series of recommendations and a phased implementation plan for the Strip District. It should be noted that portions of this Plan were completed prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. DOMI recognizes that conditions on the ground may have shifted since the Plan was initiated and is committed to working with the public and stakeholders to ensure that changing needs and priorities are fully understood before individual recommendations are advanced for implementation. The city is grateful for all the supports from the strip neighbors and businesses and committed to continue the conversation. This plan is not the end rather the beginning of our partnership towards a safer, comfortable, enjoyable and accessible multimodal Strip. Welcome to the future!

The Homewood Mobility Plan



- Homewood Mobility Plan(PDF, 18MB)
- Homewood Safety Study Memo(PDF, 9MB)
In 2021, the City of Pittsburgh Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) led a planning process to identify mobility improvements needed for automobile, bicycle, pedestrian, and transit accessibility throughout the Homewood neighborhoods. This plan is the first step towards achieving the mobility goals outlined in the 2020 Homewood Comprehensive Community Plan (HCCP). The HCCP established a vision for the future where
Homewood will be an African-American cultural destination where people choose to live, work, worship, and visit. It will be safe, green, healthy, and innovative. It will have quality schools. It will be a place that protects long-term and low-income residents and equips them to be engaged and informed.
The 2020 HCCP identified goals for creating consistent sidewalks compliant with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), ensuring Homewood residents have access to high-quality transit, and creating safe routes to school. To address these goals, this study provides an in-depth analysis of existing conditions, including a neighborhood-wide sidewalk and ramp inventory, crash analysis, in-person neighborhood safety audits of three corridors, transit service and ridership analysis, and future potential bicycle corridors for the neighborhood. The findings from this analyses are then used to identify locations and types of mobility improvements and to prioritize those improvements based on community goals and input. These projects were then assigned a priority level for implementation based on a how they address key mobility issues and concerns in the neighborhood. A summary map of the proposed projects by project type at a corridor level is shown below. All projects identified and proposed within the recommendations will require further evaluation and assessment.
Fig 01: In person Community engagement.Event- Homewood community Health & Wellness summit - August 14th, 2021.

Proposed Project Types

Safety Improvements


- Speed mitigation.
- Crash mitigation.
- ADA ramp upgrades.
Connectivity Improvements


- Sidewalk reconstruction.
- Access improvements.
- Future bicycle network identifications.
Transit Improvements

Curb Cuts


When do I need a Curb Cut Permit?

You must apply for a Curb Cut Permit under the following circumstances:
New Curb Cuts: A Curb Cut Permit application must be submitted for all new curb cuts. This includes, but is not limited to, curb cuts for off-street parking such as driveways, residential garages, parking pads, parking lots, commercial garages, and off-street loading facilities.
Existing Curb Cuts: A Curb Cut Permit application may be required for an existing curb cut when:


- No Curb Cut Permit application is on file
- The parcel’s land use or occupancy changes
- The number of parking spaces being served increases
- The property owner proposes to modify the curb cut, such as increasing the width of the throat or flare
- A new garage is proposed
- The curb cut requires repair or reconstruction (Pittsburgh Code of Ordinances § 413.02)
If you are unsure whether you need a Curb Cut Permit for proposed work, please contact the Permit Division atdomipermits@pittsburghpa.gov.

How can I tell in advance whether DOMI is likely to allow my curb cut?

All curb cuts must adhere to DOMI’sSpecifications for the Installation of Curb Cuts for Off-Street Parking(PDF, 726KB). Anyone proposing a curb cut that does not adhere to the City’s specifications must request an exception from DOMI. This includes, but is not limited to, special use or non-standard curb cuts such as drive-thrus, car washes, governor’s drives, on-site pick-up or drop-off areas, as well as any curb cuts that do not meet the City’s location, dimension, and/or design specifications. DOMI reviews exception requests on a case-by-case basis. Exception requests will be subject to additional review and may be granted at DOMI’s discretion. Note: DOMI provides no guarantee that an exception will be allowed

Request for Compliance

Most inspections start with requests that are submitted to the 311 Response Center. The requests are anonymous, and each request prompts an inspection.
Once an inspector gets a request, the inspector follows a standardized process to either close the complaint if no violation is found or issue a request for compliance if a violation is found.
Inspectors make three inspections. A description of the situation at the location, a photo, and the time/date are logged during each inspection. If the violation is not resolved by the third inspection then a criminal complaint is filed. A criminal complaint can be sent on the first inspection depending on the severity of the violation. A letter will be sent to the individual(s) in violation with a court date and location.

Understanding Notices of Violation

If you get a notice of violation and want to talk to the inspector, please call their direct number, which is on the notice. Following is an example of a notice of violation:
If you must leave a voicemail, the inspector will make every effort to call you back as quickly as possible. Please give them a day to respond. When you talk to the inspector, you can talk about the notice, try to work out the issue, schedule an appointment or follow-up inspection, or request the case file be expedited to the local magistrate as a criminal complaint for a legal determination.

Appealing a Notice

A request for appeal must be submitted in writing to DOMI within 30 days of the notice of violation. TheCode Enforcement Appeal Formcan be downloaded.

What is an Encroachment?

An Encroachment Permit allows your privately owned and maintained item or facility to occupy the public right-of-way. DOMI provides no guarantee that encroachments will be approved.
The Department of Mobility and Infrastructure classifies encroachments as Major or Minor:
Major Encroachments(PDF, 247KB)are a type of obstruction that is a permanent structure constructed or erected in a fixed location in the public right-of-way that is structurally or otherwise integral to abutting property and are assumed to be conveyed with any transfer of the building to the original permittee’s successors or assigns. Major encroachments include but are not limited to foundations, fences, vaults, retaining walls, ramps, steps, balconies and non-standard infrastructure.
Minor Encroachments(PDF, 276KB)are a type of obstruction that is minor in nature, posing little long-term physical impact on the public space and which can be removed with relative ease. Minor encroachments are often desirable or convenient, but not necessary or required, for the use and enjoyment of private property and will be considered for permit by the City where such encroachment does not interfere with the public’s safety, convenience, use, or enjoyment of the public right-of-way. Minor Encroachments include but are not limited to, planters, benches, bike racks, overhead projecting awnings without footers, overhead projecting signs, building or mechanical equipment that project over the right-of-way (ROW), and most fences.

When do I need to apply for an Encroachment Plan?

You must apply for an Encroachment Plan under the following circumstances:
New Major and Minor Encroachments: An Encroachment Plan application must be submitted for all requests for new Encroachments.
Existing Encroachments: An Encroachment Permit application may be required for an existing Encroachment when:


- no Encroachment Permit application is on file
- the parcel’s land use or occupancy changes
- the property owner proposes to modify the Encroachment
- the Encroachment requires repair or reconstruction (Pittsburgh Code of Ordinances 416.01)
If you are unsure whether you need an Encroachment Plan for proposed work, please contact the DOMI Permit Division atdomipermits@pittsburghpa.gov.

This change comes after The City streamlined its review process of outdoor dining and retail to accommodate COVID-19 safety measures under the emergency declaration, in order to support our business community, especially restaurants, during trying economic times.
These new standards guidelines give authority to the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI), through the issuance of licenses, to permits the use of portion(s) of the public right-of-way for food and retail services. The new Outdoor Dining and Retail License streamlines regulations, standards, and procedures for outdoor dining or retail activities to better serve our business community while also putting into place new expectations for license holders to maintain accessibility, appearance, safety and maintenance a part of the privilege for the use of public space.
This guidance applies to the public ROW under the stewardship of DOMI. It does not extend to any public lot, park, other public property, or private property. Other approvals from the City of Pittsburgh Department of Permits, Licenses, and Inspections (PLI), Allegheny County Health Department (ACHD), Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board (PLCB), or others may still be required. Other permits and licenses referenced in this document are not comprehensive.
Applications for retail display with four (4) seats or fewer under this subsection shall be exempt from site plan requirements of this chapter as long as they can demonstrate that they meet all requirements in Placement and Design Requirements for Use of Sidewalk in § 425.03.
