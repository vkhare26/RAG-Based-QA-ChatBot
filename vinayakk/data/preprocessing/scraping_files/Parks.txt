Citiparks Partners

TheAllegheny Regional Asset District- RAD - invests in Allegheny County's quality of life through financial support of libraries, parks and trails, arts and cultural organizations, regional attractions, sports and civic facilities, and public transit. Founded in part to remove sole financial burden from the City of Pittsburgh for regional attractions, in RAD's nearly 28 years of public support, the five regional parks have received over $150 million in operating and capital grants. RAD is proud to play such a significant role in ensuring that our regional parks are safe and vibrant places for our communities to gather, explore, and be inspired.
The Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy was founded in December 1996 by a group of citizens. A non-profit organization, the Parks Conservancy works closely with the City of Pittsburgh under an official public interest partnership agreement to restore and improve the city's park system to its full potential. To date, the Parks Conservancy has raised more than $130 million and completed more than 22 major park improvement projects. The Parks Conservancy works with thousands of volunteers and provides programming for more than 7,500 children annually. Learn more about our partners at thePittsburgh Parks Conservancy.

Rec2Tech

The Office of the Mayor began the conversation of connecting kids of all colors in the urban community to 21st Century tech skill sets. By providing a safe space in their community to foster those skills we at CitiParks look forward to fulfilling this mission through our Rec2Tech programming.
Rec2Tech will demonstrate how we can use existing city resources to increase access to technology for; and provide young people with the 21st Century learning opportunities they will need to succeed in innovation and technology fields. Ultimately, Rec2Tech will help bridge the divide and provide access to opportunities for people in their own neighborhood and community.
One of the ways in which CitiParks has been able to get our Rec2Tech Program started is through an award from the National Science Foundation. With this funding, Citiparks has teamed up with Baltimore City and the Digital Harbor Foundation to address the digital divide through innovative Rec2Tech programming.

City Farms

The CitiParks new City Farms program will work to connect the city's food producing gardens and farms more actively to city resources. Currently the City Farms initiative is working to meet with key stakeholders involved in local garden/farm efforts to inform the development of our strategy to support this important work. Our initial goals include:


- Better connecting city resources to urban food producing gardens and farms.
- Providing direct support to gardens and farms located on City property by way of planning, soliciting volunteers, and assisting with food distribution efforts.
- Creating and growing the network of local independent food growers.
- Working with various city departments to continue to increase city property that is available to support urban agriculture.
- Support educational opportunities for city residents to engage in local food production.
While we plan to have more of our program offerings developed by winter 2023, we are hosting our first event this fall! Please see the flyer below for more information and check back to stay up to date on our program offerings.
