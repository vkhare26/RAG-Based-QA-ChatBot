Building & Development Application

The Building And Development Application (BDA) is a new application type that replaces the current Zoning Development Review Application and Building Permit Application. If you're planning a construction project, this will typically be your initial step.
The intent of the Building And Development Application is that it will require no expertise in the construction process. The application uses simplified prompts that ask only for information relevant to your project. However, this page will provide some key pieces of information.
A Building And Development Application is typically requires for the following scopes:


- Renovation or repair of an existing building or structure
- Constructing an addition to an existing building or structure
- Building a new structure
- Obtaining zoning approval for structures that don't require a permit
Please seework not requiring a permitfor work that can be performed without a PLI permit. Although the Building And Development Application will inform you if you do not require a permit for your work.
Please visit our Contacts page for the Construction Inspector's contact information.

Other Agency Coordination

Every BDA will be reviewed by each of the relevant departments. This includes PLI, DCP, and DOMI. The departments will determine what is required for your project and will inform you of any additional required permits. Please seeOther Agency Coordinationfor more information on processes related to other agencies that may relate to your permit scope. There is no need to apply for a Zoning Development Review application. The reviews associated with the ZDR are now incorporated into the BDA to remove the need for you to apply twice for the same scope. If a DOMI permit is required for the BDA scope, a DOMI reviewer will create a sub-permit for you and inform you of the requirement.

Permit Process

See these web pages for additional information regarding the permitting process:

Bridge Asset Management Program

In the aftermath of the unexpected collapse of the Fern Hollow bridge in January 2022, Mayor Gainey assembled a team of experts and charged them with producing a comprehensive understanding of the state of our bridges, a list of immediate actions needed to address the most serious deficiencies, and a plan for ensuring every bridge is in a state of good repair. This team of City employees hired and oversaw the work of WSP, who brought together five engineering firms with extensive experience in infrastructure inspection, construction and maintenance as well as comprehensive asset management. The consultant team reviewed all of the bridge reports, did on-site inspections, reviewed photos, had access to advanced drone technologies and former City of Pittsburgh engineers whose institutional knowledge proved invaluable.

PLI Citation Process

List of all Operations Inspectors(PDF, 156KB)
One purpose of the Department of Permits, Licenses, and Inspections Code Enforcement is to protect the health, safety, and welfare in existing buildings and structures. PLI enforces the International Property Maintenance Code ("IPMC") as adopted by theCity of Pittsburgh Code of Ordinances Title 10 Chapter 1004. PLI also enforces theZoning Code – Title Nine.

Understanding Requests for Compliance

Most inspections start with requests that are called, texted, tweeted or electronically submitted to the 311 Response Center. The requests are anonymous, and each request prompts an inspection.
Once an inspector gets a request, the inspector follows a standardized process that was created to make sure that property owners get a legal Request for Compliance and a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue.
If you get a Request for Compliance and want to talk to the inspector, please call their direct number, which is on the request. Here is an example of a Request for Compliance:
If you must leave a voicemail, the inspector will make every effort to call you back as quickly as possible. Please give them a day to respond. When you talk to the inspector, you can talk about the request, try to work out the issue, and/or schedule an appointment or follow-up inspection.
If you do not respond to the Request for Compliance and do not fix the violation, the inspector will do a second inspection and send a second request. Again, you can still call the inspector, try to work things out, and fix the violation.
If the issue is not fixed by the deadline in the second request, the inspector does a third and final inspection. If the inspector finds the same violation, you will receive a third notice, and a criminal court complaint will be filed with the local magisterial district judge. Once the judge receives the complaint, the judge will schedule a hearing and serve the hearing documents on the property owner of record. If you are found guilty at the hearing, the judge can impose a fine. If you do not pay the fine, the judge can find you in contempt and send you to jail. To hopefully avoid all of those things, even though it is ultimately up to the judge to decide what to do once a complaint has been filed, PLI encourages you to work with your inspector and fix the violations.

Frequently Asked Questions


How do I file a complaint?

Call the 311 Response Center at 311 or, if you are outside the City, at 412-255-2621, or file anelectronic complaint form. After a complaint is filed with 311, it is forwarded to the PLI Code Enforcement Inspectors or the responsible department.

How can I determine who owns the property?

You can use theAllegheny County Real Estate Websiteto find the owner of record for a property. Please note that PLI is not responsible for the accuracy of content on websites external to the City of Pittsburgh site or on web pages external to PLI web pages.

What can PLI do about vacant properties owned by the URA or the City?

If there is a violation of City Ordinances, the City or the URA will be sent a notice of violation. Steps will be taken to raze or clean and secure the building, whichever is applicable.

How can I appeal an initial (first) notice of violation?

If the notice is for violation(s) of the City's Licensing Code (which is under Title 7 of the City Code) and/or International Property Maintenance Code ("IPMC") (which is adopted under Chapter 1004 of the City Code), then you would file the appeal with the Board of License and Inspection Review ("LIR Board"). For information on how to file an appeal with the LIR Board, please visit theLIR Board's web page.
If the notice is for violation(s) of the Uniform Construction Code ("UCC") (which is adopter under Chapter 1002 of the City Code), then you would file the appeal with the Board of Appeals ("BOA"). For information on how to file an appeal with the BOA, please visit theBOA's web page.

I received a notice of violation for my sidewalk but it is uplifted by a City tree, what do I do?

If a City tree is uplifting the sidewalk in front of your property, the property owner is responsible to fix the sidewalk. Hoever, before doing any work, you must contact the Department of Public Works' Forestry Division for root pruning at 412-665-3625 and the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure ("DOMI") for a sidewalk repair permit at 412-255-8850. The Forestry Division will prune the City tree at the proper time of year prior to the installation of the new sidewalk. Also, please note that you cannot plant, remove, or trim a City tree without a permit from Forestry. Please review the proper procedure forroot pruning and sidewalk repair(PDF, 31KB).

Clean and Lien

Once a property owner has been notified of an overgrowth or debris violation and does not bring the property into compliance, the City of Pittsburgh reserves the right to enter onto the property and take the necessary steps to remove the weeds or debris and place a lien on the property. This is referred to as a “clean and lien”.
The Department of Permits, Licenses, and Inspections issues the order to the Department of Public Works after the third and final inspection of a property. Once Public Works receives the order, they send a crew out to clean up the property.
If you have received a letter in the mail stating the City has placed a lien on your property, please contact the Finance Department at 412-255-2582 to discuss payment options.
If you believe this lien has occurred in error, please contact the Law Department at 412-255-2010.

Facade Inspections

The International Property Maintenance Code as adopted by the City of Pittsburgh and amended by City Code requires that every building facade be inspected by a licensed engineer or architect on a 5 year interval. Property owners are responsible to contact their own third party licensed professional and keep a report on file for review by a City of Pittsburgh Fire Inspector or Combined Operations Inspector upon request.
Exceptions to this Code are R-3 structures which include single-family residences and daycare or rooming house facilities with 5 or fewer residents.
Section 304.1.1. reads:

If you do not have a 5-year inspection report, contact a licensed professional immediately. Once the report is complete, contact the inspector and send the report.

Fire Prevention

In 2016, PLI created a pro-active Fire Prevention Maintenance Program to inspect all high risk occupancies such as high rises, concert venues, restaurants, and schools in order to reduce potential injuries, death, and property damage. PLI fire inspectors will identify and eliminate fire hazards by enforcing the International Fire Code through routine inspections.
Please review ourfire inspection checklist(PDF, 459KB)to ensure that your property is up-to-date on fire safety requirements.
Common violations include:


- altered sprinkler systems
- deteriorated fire pumps

The Department of Permits, Licenses and Inspections routinely inspects structures to assess building integrity. When a structure has been declared a public safety hazard, PLI will condemn the building. A building may be condemned for a number of reasons including:


- 108.1.1 Unsafe structures
- 108.1.2 Unsafe Equipment
- 108.1.3 Unfit for Human Occupancy
- 108.1.4 Unlawful Structure
- 108.2 Closing of Vacant Structure
- 109.1 Imminent Danger
- 301.3 Vacant Structure and Land
These violations are from the International Property Maintenance Code –Title 10 as adopted and amended by City Code.
There may be several remedies for a property owner of a condemned structure dependent upon the condition such as:


- Obtaining a private demolition permit
- Repair the structure to remove code violations
A structure may be condemned for a number of years before PLI considers a City funded demolition. The structure must be considered an imminent danger. The definition of imminent danger according to the International Property Maintenance Code is “a condition which could cause serious or life-threatening injury or death at any time”
Please review ourRazed, Condemned, and Under Contractdocuments for specific properties in these categories.

City Funded Demolition


What Does the City Demolish?

The City of Pittsburgh periodically solicits bids from registered and qualified demolition contractors for the demolition and removal of condemned structures.

City Funded Demolition Prioritization

The Demolition List identifies those structures that have been determined to be in imminent danger (ID) or constitute a public safety hazard.
There are many buildings in the City of Pittsburgh that have been condemned by the Department of Permits, Licenses, and Inspections and do not appear on this list. A building may be condemned for various reasons, including being determined an ‘Unlawful Structure’, ‘Structure Unfit for Human Occupancy’, an ‘Unsafe Structure’, or for ‘Imminent Danger’- experiencing partial collapse or imminent structural failure.
When a building is condemned, occupancy is prohibited and the owner of the property is notified to make necessary repairs to correct the violations. Condemned buildings are inspected on a regular basis to monitor any change to its status, however, a building may be condemned for a long period of time without necessitating demolition.

Condemned, Under Contract and Razed Properties

The following lists are updated the first week of every month.


- Condemned - buildings that are uninhabitable
- Razed - buildings that have been demolished before 12/1/2019(XLSX, 134KB)
- Razed - buildings that have been demolished or are scheduled to be demolished after 12/1/2019

PLI Fees

Building Codes


Uniform Construction Code

Construction in Pennsylvania, including the City of Pittsburgh, is regulated by thePennsylvania Construction Code Act or PA Act No. 45 of 1999, which is also commonly referred to as the Uniform Construction Code (UCC). The UCC adopts, in whole or part, the International Code Council’s (ICC) I-Codes.

Current Codes

The 2018 Base and 2018 Accessibility Codes are currently adopted under the PCCA/UCC. For more information please see PLI's2015 Code Deadline and 2018 Code Adoption(PDF, 525KB).

Pittsburgh Amendments

The City of Pittsburgh's adoption and amendment of the UCC is documented underSection 1002 of the Pittsburgh City Code. These local amendments remain applicable as the UCC is updated by the Commonwealth. While the City Ordinances reference specific 2003 I-code code sections, these amendments are enforced by PLI based on the code provision and/or topic.

Plumbing Code

Please note that PLI does not enforce the plumbing code provisions of the UCC. Please seeAllegheny County Health Department’s Plumbing Programfor plumbing code permits and regulations.

Announcements

Building & Development ApplicationPosted on: 06/13/2024
The OneStopPGH Team is excited to announce the new Building & Development Application!Beginning June 12th, 2024the Building & Development Application will replace the current Zoning Development Review Application and Building Permit Application. This streamlined application consolidates the building permit and zoning application into a single, unified application. If you're planning a construction project, this will typically be your initial step. After you submit the application, we will inform you of any additional permits required to complete your project.
Some of the important benefits of the new Building & Development Application (BDA) include:


- An application that requires no expertise in the construction process!This application uses simplified prompts that ask only for information relevant to your project.
- Inter-agency review and coordination!Every BDA will be reviewed by each of the relevant departments. The departments will determine what is required for your project and will inform you of any additional required permits.
- Co-applicants!The ability to add multiple applicants to your application so that anyone can respond to requests for more information or provide revisions.
- No more Zoning Development Review (ZDR) Application!The reviews associated with the ZDR are now incorporated into the BDA to remove the need for you to apply twice for the same scope.
