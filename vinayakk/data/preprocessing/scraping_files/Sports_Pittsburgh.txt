From professional and amateur to high school and youth sports, there’s never been a better time to hoist a trophy in the City of Champions.

THE Sports City

The City of Champions knows sports, and local pride shines bright. Home to the Steelers, Penguins and Pirates, Pittsburgh is a city that bleeds black and gold. The community rallies around sporting events big and small.

Unique Sports Facilities & World-Class Venues

From the LEED® Platinum-Certified David L. Lawrence Convention Center, which has hosted 500 teams on 36 basketball courts, to PPG Paints Arena, which features a versatile floorspace good for everything from wrestling to volleyball and hockey, the Pittsburgh region is well equipped to support a multitude of sports events. With many major universities in the city, too, collegiate-level facilities are available in several Pittsburgh neighborhoods.

PNC Park and Heinz Field, the acclaimed homes of the Pittsburgh Pirates and Pittsburgh Steelers, respectively, provide awe-inspiring atmospheres and breathtaking views of the city skyline from Pittsburgh’s North Shore. Highmark Stadium, home to the Pittsburgh Riverhounds soccer team, sits along the Monongahela River and boasts its own unbeatable cityscape view.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Easy Travel

Pittsburgh is conveniently located within 500 miles of nearly half the U.S. population, within a 90-minute flight of nearly half of North America’s population and within a six-hour car or train ride from 10 states, Washington, D.C., and Canada.

Travelers arriving by plane will enjoy the first-class service and impeccable facilities of the Pittsburgh International Airport, named 2017 Airport of the Year by Air Transport World Magazine.

Experienced, Cooperative Sports Community

Pittsburgh’s sports community makes for a great team. From venues to host universities to hotels and restaurants, pride runs deep, and there is a unified desire to showcase all the city has to offer.

About SportsPITTSBURGH

Bridge to Your Event

Bridge to Your Event

Learn how the SportsPITTSBURGH team brings events to life in Pittsburgh!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Research sports event and connect with the event planner.

The first step in successfully hosting an event in Pittsburgh is to identify organizations that are looking for an event host destination. Examples of these organizations, also known as event rights holders, include the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA), National Governing Bodies (NGBs) of the U.S. Olympic Committee, the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) and many other organizations. Their events can range in size, participant age and athletic ability.

Once our team identifies a potential event, we connect directly with the planner to learn more about the hosting requirements. We also ensure the event meets our main objective – injecting new money into the local economy. Throughout the year, we take advantage of opportunities to connect with new and current clients during sports-event focused meetings and conferences.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2. Engage Pittsburgh Local Organizing Committee and sports-specific experts to submit a bid proposal.

After learning more about the event and confirming that Pittsburgh has the right mix of competition venues, sport-specific expertise and other event needs, we engage the Pittsburgh Local Organizing Committee (PGH LOC), comprised of community stakeholders that can support all aspects of the event. The PGH LOC typically includes representatives from the offices of the mayor and county executive, the main competition venue(s), local host partners such as university athletic departments and local clubs that compete in the same sport.

This group comes together and builds a comprehensive bid proposal to submit to the client. The bid proposal can include, but is not limited to, venue details, operations, marketing and ticket sales plans, special events and an overall event budget.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3. Invite client and organization leaders to Pittsburgh for a site visit.

Once the bid proposal is submitted, and Pittsburgh is chosen to move forward in the bidding process, the event rights holder may request a site visit. During the site visit, our team leads members of the event staff and board of directors on comprehensive tours of the proposed competition venues, hotels and special event facilities to verify that Pittsburgh is well suited to host their event. The planners also will meet with local partners and PGH LOC members to discuss operations and logistics, marketing plans and special events. The staff and PGH LOC will regroup to update the original proposal based on feedback during the site visit.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4. Finalize the operations plan with an emphasis on hosting a successful event.

Once Pittsburgh is selected to host an event, the PGH LOC will develop a comprehensive operations plan. This plan will feature the PGH Commitment and best practices to ensure the event meets state and local requirements for a safe and healthy event.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

5. Execute event marketing and ticket sales plans.

The marketing and ticket sales plans are a crucial part to the success of many sports events. Our team, including the PGH LOC, creates unique, engaging and proven plans that are tailored to every sports event. In some cases, these plans are built and executed years in advance to generate awareness and excitement of the event.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

6. Welcome event attendees and create Iconic Experiences.

We strive to provide Iconic Experiences to the fans, athletes, staff and media throughout their time in Pittsburgh. After years of planning the event, we enjoy welcoming the staff, fans and participants to the City of Champions!

Power of Sports Economy

Power of Sports Economy

Pittsburgh’s sports economy drives millions of dollars in direct spend to the region.

One of the most effective ways to inject new spending into the local economy is through hosting live sports events that attract out of town attendees, including participants, event staff and fans. These individuals support the local Pittsburgh economy when they stay in our hotels, eat in our restaurants and visit our attractions. The effect of tens of thousands of event attendees staying in the region is immediate.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Impact

One in every two visitors

to a Downtown venue attends a sporting event.

Since 2005, the city has

annually hosted Hoop Group Pitt Jam Fest

, an NCAA-sanctioned event, which takes place during one of only two spring evaluation periods. The event has grown into 37 basketball courts at the David L. Lawrence Convention Center, with

more than 600 teams and 200 college coaches in attendance

.

The Pittsburgh community also is a major

hotbed for volleyball

. Annual youth volleyball events include the

East Coast Volleyball Championships (350+ teams)

and the

Junior Volleyball Association’s Steel City Freeze

, which features more than 200 boys’ and girls’ teams.

Professional Sports Teams

Pittsburgh, the City of Champions, thrives on the pride its sports teams inspire.

The success of Pittsburgh’s world championship caliber-teams, venues and events – rallying points for Pittsburghers near and far - heavily influence tourism, real estate development, media exposure, growth through relocation and community pride.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Impact

Pittsburgh is home to

three World Champion major-league professional sports teams

: Pittsburgh Pirates, Pittsburgh Penguins and Pittsburgh Steelers, along with professional teams in soccer, roller derby, ultimate frisbee and more.

Combined, the Penguins, Pirates and Steelers, annually attract

3 million fans

into the city for sports events. Including concerts and other events in their home venues, the number increases to almost 4 million attendees, annually.

In a five-year span (2013-17), these teams induced

$6 billion in direct visitor spending

for the region, generating more than $73 million in city, county and state tax revenue, annually.

Directly, or indirectly, they create an average of

10,100 jobs per year

, contributing $3.2 billion in wages for the region.

Collegiate Sports

College sports participation and competition is an important element in the sports tourism mix.

Not only do Pittsburgh’s colleges and universities recruit the best athletes from around the world to compete in their respective sports, but these student-athletes also are some of the sharpest minds that go on to make a positive impact on our region.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Impact

home to 29 colleges and universities

that represent close to every national collegiate governing body and division available for sanctioned competition. From all divisions within the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA®) to the (NAIA), (NJCAA) and even esports (NGB), Pittsburgh cherishes participation and competition in college sports.

championship-quality venues

, including UPMC Events Center (Robert Morris University), Petersen Events Center & Sports Complex (University of Pittsburgh), Tippen Gymnasium (Clarion University), UPMC Cooper Fieldhouse (Duquesne University), Trees Pool (University of Pittsburgh) and the RMU Island Sports Center (Robert Morris University).

$42.84 million in direct spending

Calling Acrisure Stadium home, Pitt Football has a pedigree of success, recently adding the 2021 ACC Championship to their accomplishments to go with their 9 national titles. The team has also produced household football names such as Dan Marino, Kenny Pickett, Aaron Donald and Mike Ditka. The Pitt Men’s Basketball team plays at the Peterson Events Center in front of their loud and lively student section, the Oakland Zoo.

Community Involvement

Community Involvement

Legacy projects within the Pittsburgh community are wide and varied.

The legacy of sports in the Pittsburgh community reaches far beyond tickets sold and dollars funneled into the local economy. Sports events hosted in our region provide an opportunity to connect participants with community experiences with infinite impact potential.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Impact

Legacy projects within the Pittsburgh community are wide and varied. Current and past project examples include:

New Opportunities for Participation

Pittsburgh is home to a variety of local sports related nonprofits, providing incredible opportunities for youth involvement. Supported by the NHL’s Pittsburgh Penguins ownership group, The

Pittsburgh Penguins Foundation

is a local nonprofit focused on charitable and community outreach efforts benefitting the youth in the region. The organization has created a

Hockey for All

initiative, which includes a variety of youth programs aimed at getting boys and girls involved with the sport. From providing basic skills and development, to supplying new equipment and updating old rinks, this initiative has created incredible opportunities for the local Pittsburgh community to participate in the sport of hockey.

Exposure for Causes

The

Pittsburgh Vintage Grand Prix

(PVGP) is a one-of-a-kind, 10-day vintage racing event with a meaningful mission: benefitting local charities. While celebrating and honoring founding auto enthusiasts, the PVGP annually raises funds to help provide residential care, treatment and support for autistic and intellectual/developmentally disabled individuals in Western PA. Since 1983, the world-class event has

raised and donated nearly $6 million

to the Autism Society of Pittsburgh and Merakey Allegheny Valley School.

Volunteerism and Brand Association

One major, annual event with thousands of volunteers is the

DICK’S Sporting Goods Pittsburgh Marathon

. In the city, the marathon takes over the entire weekend with more than 40,000 runners. Ranging from medical personnel to assisting with the expo and hydration stations along the course, the Pittsburgh Marathon is

supported by more than 4,000 volunteers

. These volunteer opportunities are a way for local corporations to actively engage with this popular event and to continue to build strong brand association. The active volunteerism is a testament to the endless support of the Pittsburgh community.

Iconic Events with an Impact on the Community

The interaction between visiting athletes and fans amongst the local community is key to hosting a successful event. When sports events come to Pittsburgh, it’s apparent they are immediately welcomed by the Pittsburgh community. During the 2019 NCAA Division I Wrestling Championships and Fan Festival,

local Pittsburghers were able to directly participate in the event

through Fan Festival programming, which featured local women wrestling groups, a sports-related STEM program, autograph signing sessions and more. Through collaboration between sports events and the local community, Pittsburgh is able to consistently showcase our city as the ultimate sports destination.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When done correctly, sports events can flip the script and provide their own iconic experiences for Pittsburgh residents.
