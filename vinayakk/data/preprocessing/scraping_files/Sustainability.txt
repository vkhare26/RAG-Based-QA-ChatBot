Sustainability

Sustainability and resilience empowers all Pittsburghers to address the climate crisis through reducing pollution, improving access to food, and integrating the environment into their daily decisions. As a division, we champion preventative resilience strategies in partner operations in order to mitigate stressors facing the City and prepare for future shocks. We also advise City officials, departments and partners to enable an enduring and adaptable city through holistic decision making.

Climate Action Plan

Climate Action Plan 3.0 lays out strategies through which Pittsburgh can reduce greenhouse gas emissions within city limits and within City operations. This will lessen Pittsburgh’s contribution to global climate change.

Resilient Pittsburgh

Why does Pittsburgh need resilience? Air quality issues. Inequality. Public health challenges. Flash floods. Infrastructure failure. Extreme weather. These are just a few of the chronic stressors and acute shocks that challenge and threaten Pittsburgh.

Food Systems

In a city where more than 1 in 5 residents face food insecurity—more than twice the national average—there is a critical need for the City of Pittsburgh to intervene through leadership and collaboration. Tackling this issue will require input from a variety of actors, such as the City, nonprofits, city agents, but most importantly, the local Pittsburgh community.

Climate Action Plan

Pittsburgh has already begun to experience the effects of climate change with harsher winters, hotter summers, record setting precipitation, and increased numbers of invasive species. Coordinated, concentrated and comprehensive carbon mitigation action is needed to reduce the severity of regional impacts and prepare for low carbon economy. To address these challenges, Pittsburgh has created the Climate Action Plan.

Measuring Pittsburgh's Impact

Pittsburgh’s goal is to measure climate and ecological impact, and report findings, annually. The Greenhouse Gas Inventory quantifies emissions and analyzes the sources of those emissions. This data helps to inform mitigation strategies and is essential for tracking progress toward future reduction goals.
Chapter One
2018 Greenhouse Gas Inventory

Energy Generation and Distribution

By 2030, Pittsburgh will reduce emissions by 50% from 2003 amounts and power all City facilities with 100% clean energy. Through efforts to reduce line loss and modernizing energy systems, this goal can become a reality.
Chapter Two

Buildings and End Use Efficiency

As part of fighting climate change in our city, Pittsburgh’s goal is to reduce energy and water consumption by 50% by 2030. This goal can be achieved through improving the quality of energy and water use data, ensuring all new buildings are carbon neutral, mitigating high energy burdens in vulnerable communities, reducing sewer volume by 50% from 2013 levels, and improving efficiency of public street lights and traffic signals.
Chapter Three

Transportation and Land Use

Pittsburgh’s goals are to reduce on-road transportation emissions by 50%, reduce vehicle miles traveled per capita by 50%, reduce freight emissions by 25%, and increase vehicle electrification. Through increasing walking and biking commutes, increasing Port Authority bus and light rail ridership, and expanding transit hubs, these goals can be achieved.
Chapter Four

Waste and Resource Recovery

Pittsburgh strives to be zero-waste landfilled by 2030. By modernizing waste collection systems, improving education around waste diversion efforts, increasing composting, and enforcing waste policies, Pittsburgh can reach this goal.
Chapter Five

Food and Agriculture

Improving local food systems in the Greater Pittsburgh area is a key piece of climate mitigation for the city. Increasing the supply and demand of local produce strengthens the local food system, increases local profitability, and decreases the climate impact of transportation and sales.
Chapter Six

Urban Ecosystems

Urban ecosystems—cities, towns and urban strips constructed by humans—impact the environment around them. Pittsburgh’s goal is to increase tree canopy and biodiversity, improve urban soil conditions, prioritize habitat conversion, and implement guidelines for additional greenways.
Chapter Seven

2030 Goals

Pittsburgh has established six climate mitigation goals to achieve by 2030, including:
- 100% renewable energy in City facilites
- 50% energy and water use reduction in City facilities
- Operate a fossil-fuel-free fleet
- Divestment of the City pension fund from fossil fuels
- 50% transportation emissions reduction citywide
- Zero-waste citywide
Pittsburgh is committed to:


- Milan Urban Food Policy Pact
- United Nations Sustainable Development Goals
- Sierra Club Ready for 100
- Carbon Disclosure Project
- Biophilic Cities Network
- Urban Sustainability Directors Network
- Pittsburgh Region Clean Cities
- American Cities Climate Challenge

Carbon Mitigation Actions


Transportation

Through leveraging grant funding and vehicle turnover cycles, the City of Pittsburgh has been purchasing alternatively fueled and hybrid vehicles for its fleet as technology becomes available. These vehicles incluse electric sedans for building inspectors, hybrid police vehicles, and CNG refuse trucks.
In 2019, the Sustainability & Resilience division convened an Electric Vehicle Task Force to provide recommendations to enable residents and fleets to easily charge and operate electric vehicles. In 2021, the City, in partnership with the American Cities Climate Challenge and the Pittsburgh Parking Authority, developed an EV Charging Strategic Plan for Pittsburgh Public Facilities. Read both documents below.

Climate Challenge

The Climate Challenge is a Bloomberg Philanthropies initiative that aims to accelerate and deepen U.S. cities’ efforts to create the greatest impact through 2020 and showcase the benefits that climate solutions bring, like good jobs, cleaner air and cost savings. Pittsburgh is one of 25 cities chosen for its vision and leadership on climate action and is tackling carbon emissions in the four key areas of the Climate Challenge: reducing building energy use, increasing renewable energy, reducing vehicle travel and electrifying vehicles.

Resilient Pittsburgh


Why does Pittsburgh need resilience?

Air quality issues. Inequality. Public health challenges. Flash floods. Infrastructure failure. Extreme weather.
There are just a few of the chronic stressors and acute shocks that challenge and threaten Pittsburgh. Though Pittsburgh has made significant progress in improving environmental stewardship and transitioning from a city in decline to a thriving hub of innovation, technology, education and medicine, we recognize there is still a need for focused, inclusive efforts to ensure all Pittsburgh residents and visitors live well and succeed.
In 2014, the City of Pittsburgh joined the 100 Resilient Cities Network, powered by the Rockefeller Foundation, and with the support of the RAND Corporation, has since engaged with more than 2,000 Pittsburghers to understand the City's resilience challenges and develop analyses, reports and actions to address them.

Food Systems

In a city where more than 1 in 5 residents face food insecurity—more than twice the national average—there is a critical need for the City of Pittsburgh to intervene through leadership and collaboration. Tackling this issue will require input from a variety of actors, such as the City, nonprofits, city agents, but most importantly, the local Pittsburgh community.
Local food is a crucial component in confronting the issue of food insecurity. Local food is defined as food that was grown or produced within a certain radius of where it is consumed. Local food movements aim to connect food producers and consumers in the same geographic region to develop more self-reliant and resilient food networks. Local food is fresher, lasts longer, and tastes better than food that has traveled hundreds of miles. Buying local food also has huge positive effects on the environment – by buying food that has traveled fewer miles and that was grown without pesticides and high gas emission practices, our food can help us live in a more sustainable way.

Local Food Is More Sustainable


What is “local” food?

Local food is food that was grown or produced within a certain radius of where it is consumed. The USDA uses a 400-mile radius for its definition of local food, however some local food advocates have stricter criteria of less than 100 miles. Pittsburgh food distributors and organizations, including Parkhurst, Paragon Foods, Giant Eagle, Sustainable Pittsburgh, and the Pittsburgh Public School System, promote a 150-mile radius for food to be considered locally sourced.

Why is local food important?

It is estimated that, on average, food in the U.S. travels more than 1,500 miles from the farm to your plate. Local food is fresher, lasts longer and tastes better than food that has traveled many miles to reach you. In addition, most of those foods are grown using heavy fertilizer and pesticide applications, both of which are made from fossil fuels and cause environmental damage and increased greenhouse gas emissions. Local food is therefore more sustainable in a number of ways.
Buying local food also adds to the economic vibrancy of the region. In Western PA, regional farmers offer a wide variety of food, including vegetables, meat, dairy, fruit, and grains. When food producers sell locally, they get more money in their pockets since there are fewer steps to the sale.

Community Supported Agriculture

Community Supported Agriculture is a partnership between local farmers and supportive members. Farmers receive payment for an entire season up front, and members become shareholders who get a weekly share of harvested produce.
This arrangement benefits both farmers and members – farmers have a guaranteed market and money to pay for labor and supplies at the beginning of the season, and shareholders get fresh food all season while knowing the origin of their how and how it is grown.

Urban Agriculture

Urban agriculture is a way of using city land to grow food, which is a great way to help decrease food insecurity and to stabilize local food systems. It is also ecologically friendly and helps increase biodiversity.
Pittsburgh has a wealth ofcommunity gardens, school gardens, and farms, and many resources for anyone who wants to start growing! If you're interested in learning how to grow food, get access to land for gardening, or getting permits to raise bees, chicken, ducks, or mini goats, here are some resources to help you get started.

Food Insecurity

One in five Pittsburgh residents is food insecure. This means that over 60,000 residents struggle to have healthy, adequate, and culturally appropriate food.
Food insecurity exists when a family is unable to provide enough food for each member of their household to live a healthy, active life. This is a problem that millions of people across the United States face every day, and a variety of situations can cause a family to become food insecure, including lay-offs, accidents, and illness. Some causes of food insecurity are more systemic, but no matter the cause, the effects of food insecurity have a wide impact. Food insecurity can cause serious health problems, inhibit a child’s development, and force seniors living on a fixed income to choose between food and health care.
The2020 FeedPGH Report(PDF, 16MB)describes the four dimensions of food insecurity, based on the United Nation’s 2018 report, identifies 23Healthy Food Priority Areasin Pittsburgh through extensive mapping, outlines the City's goals to achieve Zero Hunger, and pinpoints some key next steps.
TheFeedPGH City Council District Food Security Analysis(PDF, 8MB)provides insight into food insecurity in each Council District. Considering factors such as household poverty, vehicle ownership, fresh food store walk-ability, and diet-related chronic disease, the city has determined Healthy Food Priority Areas. These areas are the places of highest need and require focused effort in order to promote food equity in Pittsburgh.
TheHFPA Dashboardcan be used to explore the underlying data and equity metrics.

Food Waste

Food waste costs the country nearly $218 billion per year, but money is not the only issue associated with food waste. Along with food, valuable resources like water and farmland are wasted when food is thrown out.
Organic waste, including food and yard waste, make up 28% of what we throw away into landfills, which takes up space and releases methane, a greenhouse gas. Pittsburgh has identified the goal of being a “Zero Waste” City by 2030, and as part of Pittsburgh’s Climate Action Plan, we want to work towards eliminating organic waste from our landfills. This requires composting mechanisms for individuals and businesses.
Eliminating food waste has the potential to be extremely impactful in Pittsburgh. As part ofThe Natural Resource Defense Council’s Food Matters Cities Project, NRDC used aFood Waste Calculator(PDF, 544KB)to estimate Pittsburgh’s food waste and assessed the potential areas of impact for decreasing food waste.
Pittsburgh is taking steps to educate, pilot, and implement proven strategies to reduce our food waste, and there are steps you can take, too!

Reduce, Reuse, Rescue, Recycle

Reduce

A little planning goes a long way to helping you buy only what you need. With all the recipes available on line, make a list, and substitute what you already have in stock when you can.
Shop local, in season, and at farmers markets when you can: Local food is fresher and lasts longer.
Start big and then mix it up: Roast a whole chicken, then have stir fry, chicken salad, and chicken pot pie. You can also make your own stock from chicken bones and vegetable scraps. (see Reuse below)
Store food properly: Tomatoes, potatoes, garlic should never be stored in the fridge; some vegetables like bananas and avocados release ethylene gas while ripening, and can cause other foods to prematurely spoil. If you’re not able to use vegetables right away, many can be chopped and frozen for use later.

Reuse

Food scraps can also have a second life in some unique ways. Bones and vegetable scraps can be used to make stock for soup, and some foods like lettuce hearts and pineapple tops can be used to grow more food. Having animals like chickens can be a great way to “reuse” your food scraps, too! Make it into eggs!

Rescue

Food rescue relies on people who truly care about the problem of food waste. Organizations like the Greater Pittsburgh Community Food Bank have been rescuing food from retail locations and gleaning from farms for many years. In addition, 412 Food Rescue has the largest volunteer-led food transport network in a single urban region, and does an incredible job of connecting leftover food to people who can use it.

Recycle

At a certain point, there is no other option but to discard spoiled food, however, it can be recycled to enrich soil through composting. The City of Pittsburgh encourages its residents to compost their organic waste.
Composting is a method of turning organic waste into usable soil, and has many benefits including enriching the soil, retaining soil nutrients, and reducing methane emissions. As a resident of the City of Pittsburgh, you can begin composting to help keep Pittsburgh clean and sustainable, and to do your part in helping our planet.
If you don’t have a space at home to begin your own composting, the city of Pittsburgh has a Food Waste Drop-Off system. Simply drop off your food waste at our city-runfarmer’s marketsat East Liberty on Mondays or Northside on Fridays. These food scraps will be collected by a local compost company to be transformed into fertile soil amendment to be used on local urban farming and gardening projects! Collect your food waste at home in large yogurt containers or other plastic covered containers. To reduce odor, store in your freezer or refrigerator and place a layer of shredded newspaper at the bottom of your storage container.

Current Laws

Section 619.14 of City Ordinances Composting activities are classified as Urban Agriculture in Section912.07of the Pittsburgh Zoning Code. Any and all composting activities, including residential accessory use permitted by right as described in Section912.02.
