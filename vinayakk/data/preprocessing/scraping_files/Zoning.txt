Zoning

The Division of Zoning and Development Review (Zoning Division) of the Department of City Planning administers the City of Pittsburgh Zoning Code and Historic Preservation Code. The Zoning Division is the first stop for getting most construction permits in the City of Pittsburgh. The approval processes involved vary by project type, the scope of work, and location (see theDepartment of Permits, Licenses, and Inspectionsfor more information).

What are the codes and regulations administered?

The City of Pittsburgh Zoning Code regulates land use and activities within the City boundaries. The intent of zoning regulations is to allow property owners the reasonable use of their property insofar as the use is not detrimental to abutting properties or to the neighborhood. The City of Pittsburgh is divided into different Zoning Districts that regulate the potential uses of a property.Interactive mapsshow the zoning and parcel information.

Do building permits require zoning approval?

Most building permits, which are issued by the Department of Permits, Licenses, and Inspections, requirezoning approval, also known as the Record of Zoning Approval or ROZA, including those for interior renovations when changing the use of the structure. However, only some will require a site plan (new parking, additions, HVAC, etc.). SeeSite Plan Requirementsfor details.

Can I come in to look at someone else's plan or a specific file?

Yes, once an application has been filed, it is public record. Please emailzoning@pittsburghpa.govwith the request.
For older files, or for large or complex requests, please file a Right to Know request.Make this request onlineor emailopenrecords@pittsburgh.pa.gov.

How can I find out if there is a certificate of occupancy or a record of zoning approval for a property?

AllCertificates of Occupancycan be searched online.

Can I view a zoning map for the City of Pittsburgh?

Yes, aninteractive zoning mapis available.

Can a single-family home be converted into a two-family home?

Not necessarily. Even when the district allows a two-family dwelling, all applicable code requirements must be met in order for that use to be approved for a specific location. These requirements include side yard setbacks, lot area, and parking requirements. Please consult with Zoning staff.

How do I change the zoning district for my parcel?

Make sure the intention is to change the zoning district of a property rather than simply wanting to change the use of the property (more common). If the intent is to change the use of the property, please consult zoning staff for the appropriate process.
In most cases, rezoning land is done at a larger scale with multiple parcels rather than a single property or for a single development. There are a few exceptions, and if you are interested in filing for a rezoning application, please file a pre-application request.

When is a property certification required?

Aproperty certificationis required whenever there is a real estate closing on a property due to a sale or refinance. (Note: this is the same thing that used to be called the zoning certificate.) It is a document intended for the benefit of a buyer or lender to let them know the zoning district of the property, the legality of use, if there is an occupancy permit on file, if the property is in a local historic district, and if there are any active code violations on file.

How can I resolve a dispute about a property line?

Property line issues are not handled by the City. You should contact a magistrate or an attorney.

Do I need special approval to run my business out of my home?

A home occupation can typically be approved throughBasic Zoning Review. The Zoning Code criteria for review of home occupation is listed in912.05.

Who do I contact about the consolidation or subdivision of a property?

See theConsolidations/Subdivisions pagefor information about this process and appropriate contacts.

Can I obtain a copy of the zoning code?

The Zoning Code is available on theMunicode website. Select Title Nine for the Zoning Code.

How can I inquire about a city-owned property?

Visit theReal Estate Division in the Finance Departmentwebsite or call them at 412-255-2300.

Where can I learn about floodplain regulations?

Visit the Department of City Planning’sfloodplain website.

How can I obtain a handicapped parking space on the street?

Make your request through the311 Response Center. Department of Mobility and Infrastructure will contact you regarding your request.

Are Floodplain Permits separate from the ZDR?

Beginning October 3, 2022, new Zoning (ZDR) and PLI applications with work occurring in the floodplain will apply for a Floodplain Permit though the OneStopPGH portal. This permit type will replace the floodplain review currently housed in Zoning Development Review (ZDR). With this new formatting of the application, applicants will be able to apply for a single floodplain review for the entire construction project; check the boxes to identify all of your work.
Please seePLI's Floodplain Review Policyfor in-depth information.

Property Certification

Apply on OneStopPGH

What is a Property Certification?

The Property Certification Application is used to verify three conditions on the subject property, in accordance with Pennsylvania Act of Assembly #652, approved September 20, 1961:


- Certification ofZoning Classification(PDF, 429KB)and Legality of Use
- Certification of City Historic Designation
- Certification of Code Violations and/or Unsafe Conditions

When is a Property Certification required?

A property certification is required whenever there is a real estate closing on a property due to a sale or refinance. (Note: this is the same thing that used to be called the zoning certificate.) It is a document intended for the benefit of a buyer or lender to let them know the zoning district of the property, the legality of use, if there is an occupancy permit on file, if the property is in a local historic district, and if there are any active code violations on file.
The application fee is $100 per application due at the time the application is submitted.
Fill out all applications online atOneStopPGH.

Who files for Property Certification?

The owner of the subject property or the owner's agent may make an application for a Certificate of Zoning Classification. Typically, the application is used when the property is changing ownership or when the owner is re-financing a mortgage.

What do Current and Proposed Use mean?

The application asks you to list the current and proposed use of the property before and after the real estate transaction. They can be the same if no change in use is proposed. For online applications, you will be required to select a use that best fits from the official Use Classifications within Pittsburgh’s Zoning Code, which are found in Chapter 911.02. Select all uses on the property being certified. While there is a category for “vacant,” that is for when a building or property is vacant. There is not an “other” category. If you are unsure about the correct Use Classification you may inquire with Zoning Staff atzoning@pittsburghpa.govor by calling 412-255-2241.
Thefull list of Zoning Code uses and their definitions(PDF, 429KB)can be found here.

Do I need to list the number of units?

On the application form, include the current and proposed number of residential units. While a typical rowhouse is only one residential unit, there are exceptions, and therefore it is important to list the correct numbers so that staff can accurately complete your application.

How will I receive the completed certificate?

Completed property certifications filed through OneStopPGH can be downloaded through the applicant's user profile and will not be emailed back to the applicant.

Can I use the certificate instead of a certificate of occupancy or a record of zoning approval?

No. The Property Certificate does not certify that these premises are legally occupied or that the structure meets all Zoning Code and Building Code requirements unless a Certificate of Occupancy has been issued for the actual use of the property by the Dept. of Permits, Licenses, and Inspections.

For more information about Property Certifications, email questions to:zoning@pittsburghpa.govor call 412-255-2241.

Consolidations/Subdivisions


What are consolidations and subdivisions?

A consolidation is when more than one lot is joined together legally to create a new single lot. A subdivision is when a lot is legally separated into more than one lot.

Why may I be required to consolidate?

Reasons for consolidation include:


- For tax reasons, so that a property owner receives only one bill.
- To conform to the international building code, which does not allow construction across a lot line.
- For zoning requirements, to keep accessory structures such as a garage on the same lot as the primary structure.

Is a survey required?

Yes, the County will not accept your plan for recording if it is not stamped by a licensed professional.

How are consolidations and subdivisions approved?

Consolidations and subdivisions are reviewed by the Department of City Planning for compliance with the City's zoning code and subdivision ordinance. Applications for minor subdivisions and consolidations, which involve an area of land that is smaller than 50,000 square feet and do not create 8 or more new parcels, can be approved administratively. The Planning Commission holds hearings to review applications for major consolidations and subdivisions. Planning Commission meetings are held virtually. View more information about thePlanning Commission.

What is the first step in the process?

Please emailZoning and Development Reviewif you have any questions about subdividing or consolidating lots.
You must get a subdivision or consolidation plan prepared by a licensed surveyor before submitting an application for approval.

What are the submission requirements?

Applicants are required to submit an application and a subdivision or consolidation plan, prepared by a licensed surveyor, online through OneStopPGH.
Thesubdivision regulations(PDF, 3MB)are available.

How much is the fee?

The application fee is $175 for minor applications and $200 for major applications. Application Fees are non-refundable.

Should the applicant attend the hearing?

Major subdivisions and consolidations are presented by Staff, who are able to answer questions from Planning Commission. Applicants can attend the hearing, but are not required to participate.

What happens when a consolidation or subdivision is approved?

The registered surveyor or applicant should contact the Zoning Division after the scheduled Commission Hearing to obtain the approved plan. The plan must then be taken to the Allegheny County Real Estate Department for recording. Their office is located at 542 Forbes Avenue. After the plan is recorded, the applicant is required to contact the City Planning Department with the Plan Book volume and page number.

Institutional Master Plan


What is an Institutional Master Plan?

Institutional Master Plans provide a framework for development of institutions, such as hospitals and colleges, which control large areas of land within the City. These institutions are unique because they generally contain a greater density of development than surrounding areas, are a source of substantial employment, and are usually located immediately adjacent to residential neighborhoods.
As such, the Institutional Master Plan allows the institutions the flexibility to plan and develop project and campus-based standards for building height and mass, parking, urban design and neighborhood compatibility.
Finally, Institutional Master Plans provide a level of understanding to the public and the community about the potential growth of institutions and the resultant impacts. All institutions located in Education Medical Institutional zoning districts are required to have a current Institutional Master Plan.

What needs to be in the Institutional Master Plan?

A complete outline of topics and issues required to be covered in an IMP is detailed in Section 905.03.D.2 of the Zoning Code.
These topics broadly are:


- Planning Horizon of 10 and 25 Years
- Mission and Objectives of the Institution
- Existing Property and Uses
- Needs of the Institution
- Ten-Year Development Envelope
- Twenty-Five-Year Development Sites
- Transportation Management Plan
- Environmental Protection Plan
- Open Space and Pedestrian Circulation Plan
- Urban Design Guidelines
- Neighborhood Protection Strategy

What is the first step in the Institutional Master Plan process?

The institution and their planning consultant must hold apre-applicationmeeting with City Planning staff to discuss the Institutional Master Plan process and requirements specific to each project.

May institutions file for a zone change with the Institutional Master Plan?

Yes, this process should be run concurrently with the Institutional Master Plan. Please speak to a City Planning staff member about this application.

How do I make an application?

- From theOneStopPGH online portal, select a Planning Applications and then Master Plan/Zone Change Petition.
- Complete the form and upload a draft of the Institutional Master Plan.

How much is the fee?

The fee is one of the following:


- $10,000 for a new Institutional Master Plan
- $5,000 for an update to an existing Institutional Master Plan
- $3,800 for a Zone Change Petition
Fees are non-refundable, including if the Institutional Master Plan is not approved.

What happens after an application has been filed?

First, scoping for the traffic analysis will be completed. The institution and its consultant will have a meeting with the Department of City Planning and the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure (DOMI) transportation staff to discuss what should be included in any transportation study. While the transportation analysis is being completed, the draft Institutional Master Plan goes through the City Planning staff review process. This includes reviews of accessibility, neighborhood compatibility, zoning and urban design. The design review is the only review with a formalized process.

What is the design review process?

The design review process is the review related to architecture and urban design. For Institutional Master Plans, this encompasses the urban design guidelines and the location, height and setbacks of the buildings within the ten-year development plan. For more information about design review, please visitdesign review.

What community outreach should the institution do?

Early and throughout the planning process, it is recommended that the applicant reach out to multiple community stakeholders, including neighborhood groups, adjacent residents, City Council representatives, other institutions, and other relevant stakeholders.
If the project is within the boundaries of a Registered Community Organization (RCO), a Development Activities Meeting with the community will be required. This Development Activities Meeting must occur at least 30 days before the first City public hearing. This process will be discussed at the pre-application meeting.
In addition, as required by the Zoning Code, City Planning will mail surrounding property owners and post around the institution notice of the Institutional Master Plan filing 21 days prior to the Planning Commission hearing. Please note that this requirement should be included in any time frame estimate for approvals.

What is the Planning Commission process?

City Planning staff work with the applicant throughout the review process. After staff has determined that all of the required topics are adequately addressed, the Institutional Master Plan is scheduled for Planning Commission review.
The Commission meets virtually bi-weekly on Tuesday afternoons with briefing starting around 1:00 p.m. and the public meeting starting at 2:00 p.m. A briefing to the Commission is the first step. This is an off-the-record presentation to introduce the project to members. It also provides the opportunity for the Commissioners to ask questions they want the applicant to further address.
Then the project returns usually one month later for on-the-record hearing and action. (Larger Institutional Master Plans may make multiple presentations before the Commission.) A full presentation is made again and then public comment is taken. The Commission will generally vote at that meeting to approve or disapprove the plan. If the Commission disapproves the plan, then it still proceeds to City Council, where it needs an affirmative vote by at least seven members to be adopted.
At each hearing, City Planning staff will introduce the project and then a representative of the institution or their planning firm will make the presentation.

What happens after the Planning Commission Process?

City Planning staff prepare legislation to send to the Law Department for review and then to City Council.

What is involved in the City Council process?

The City Clerk’s office schedules the Institutional Master Plan for a City Council committee hearing. The applicant should work on this scheduling with the City Council member for the location of the institution. The applicant presents to the Council committee and public testimony is heard. If approved in committee, the plan is voted on during a full Council hearing.

How long does the Institutional Master Plan approval process take?

The entire process, from making an application to City Council approval, takes approximately six months. This varies depending on the complexity of the plan and on Planning Commission and City Council schedules.

When can an institution receive approval for the projects identified in the Institutional Master Plan?

For new buildings proposed in the plan, Planning Commission and/or Zoning Board of Adjustment approval may be required after the plan is approved. This approval will be specific to the building and require design review and zoning review. The Planning Commission procedure is similar to that for the plan, although City Council approval is not required. For information about the Zoning Board process, please visit theZBA page.

Additional Information

For more information, please consult the Zoning Code, including sections 905.03.D and 922.12.

Specially Planned Districts


What are Specially Planned Districts?

Specially Planned Districts are intended to provide a flexible framework for alternative forms of development on very large sites of City-wide importance. These create efficient, functional and attractive urban areas that incorporate high quality urban design, a variety of public amenities, and protection of natural resources.

What is a Preliminary Land Development Plan?

A Preliminary Land Development Plan is a master plan for specially planned districts and include details for infrastructure, development patterns, landscape design and architectural details, and is accompanied by zoning text that is specific to the Specially Planned District.

What are the minimum thresholds for the establishment of a Specially Planned District?

The following thresholds are used for the establishment of a Specially Planned District:


- Development site must comprise a contiguous area of land no less than 15 acres.
- 100 percent of the land in an Specially Planned District shall be controlled by the applicant from the time of application through ownership or sales options.
- Specially Planned Districts shall be in a location that is suitable for the proposed development, evidenced by compliance with plans and policy documents adopted by the Planning Commission and by demonstrating compatibility with development in adjacent areas.

How are Specially Planned Districts created?

After a public hearing, Planning Commission votes on the Preliminary Land Development Plan and makes a recommendation to City Council on the Zoning Code text. After a public hearing at City Council, the Council may vote on the legislation. Finally, the Mayor may approve the Zoning Code text.

How are individual building projects approved in a Specially Planned District?

Once a Preliminary Land Development Plan and subsequent zoning changes have been approved, building plans are reviewed in the form of Final Land Development Plans.
Final Land Development Plans are subject to the City's design review process and final approval by Planning Commission.
An Final Land Development Plan is approved based on its compliance with the previously approved Preliminary Land Development Plan, unless an updated Preliminary Land Development Plan is submitted and approved with the Final Land Development Plan application.

Pre-Application Meeting


What is a pre-application meeting?

A pre-application meeting is an optional service provided by the Department of City Planning to advise prospective applicants on the applicable zoning and planning approval processes before an application is submitted. This initial discussion helps prospective applicants understand these processes. This is particularly helpful for those not familiar with the Zoning Code and related review processes.
The meeting is not required, but highly recommended for anyone considering a project that will require Zoning Review with Planning Commission or a project that will require a complex Site Plan Review.
The meeting may be required if any of the following thresholds are met:


- $100,000 for Exterior Renovations on Commercial Building Permits
- Any new commercial structure or additions of 5,000 sq. ft. or greater
- Any application with more than 20 parking spaces
- Any Master Plan/Rezoning Application
- Any Historic Nomination
- Any Zoning Protest Appeal
- Any Advertising Sign Application
Common topics discussed at these meetings are:


- Zoning district and requirements for the project
- Development review approval process
- Applicable public hearings and notices
- Design review process
- Development Activities Meeting(s)
- Local community groups
The purpose of these meetings is to discuss the processes under the jurisdiction of the Department of City Planning. Questions about building codes or other non-planning aspects will not be discussed.

What is the fee for the meeting?

There is a $250 fee for each pre-application meeting. This fee is due prior to scheduling the meeting and can be paid on the OneStopPGH online portal.

Who will be there?

City Planning staff relevant to the project may include the Zoning Administrator, zoning staff, design staff, and the neighborhood planner. For projects in the Uptown Public Realm District, representatives from the Green Building Alliance will attend. The applicant is welcome to bring anyone involved in the project such as the property owner, architect, developer, or other parties.

What materials should prospective applicants bring to the meeting?

Planning Reviews, Public Notices and Public Hearings

Applications submitted to the Department of City Planning for review may require Zoning Review and/or one or more of the Planning reviews, public notices and/or public hearings listed below depending on the location and scope of work. Please note that this list is not exhaustive, but includes the most common components.

Zoning Review Process

Zoning Review is the overarching review for most Zoning Development Review applications. There are three levels of Zoning Review: Basic Zoning Review, Site Plan Review, and Zoning Review with Planning Commission. The level of review applicable for any given project will depend on the location and scope of work for that project. Below is a general overview of the three levels of Zoning Review.
In some cases, the Zoning Review will be contingent upon the successful completion of one or more additional reviews, posted notices and/or public hearings administered or coordinated by the Department of City Planning. These additional components also depend on the location and scope of work.
In addition, if the project location does not have a valid address, final approval will not be issued until an Address Request application has been successfully completed and an Address Verification Letter has been issued.
Projects that successfully complete the Zoning Review Process typically receive at least one approval document called the Record of Zoning Approval (ROZA), but may also receive others such as the Certificate of Appropriateness, to submit to the Department of Permits, Licenses, and Inspections along with any other required documentation in order to apply for the appropriate permits issued by that department.
All development review projects, including signs, require a Zoning and Development Review Application, which may be submitted through the OneStopPGH online portal. Most applications filed online require a filing fee, paid via credit card or e-check. (Please note a service charge will apply). Hard copy applications and checks may still be mailed or dropped off at the OneStopPGH Counter, 412 Boulevard of the Allies, Pittsburgh, PA 15219, open daily from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m.

Site Plan Review


What is site plan review?

Site Plan Review is the second of the three levels of Zoning Review, which is the primary component of most Zoning Development Review applications. During Site Plan Review, staff confirm that a proposed development complies with all applicable Zoning Code standards and has completed any other related components. While still an administrative review, Site Plan Review is a more detailed review than Basic Zoning Review.

Is a pre-application meeting required?

A pre-application meeting may be required for projects meeting or exceeding the following thresholds:


- $100,000 for exterior renovations on Commercial Building Permits
- Any new commercial structures or additions of 5,000 sq. ft. or greater
- Any application with more than 20 parking spaces
- Any Master Plan/Rezoning Application
- Any historic nomination
- Any zoning protest appeal
Applicants wishing to schedule a pre-application meeting should apply using the OneStopPGH online application portal. The applicant will be notified via email or through the online permitting system and will be advised if zoning staff determine the questions may be answered more efficiently without a meeting.
Meetings are held at the Department of City Planning, 200 Ross Street, Pittsburgh. For more information, see thePre-Application website.

When is a site plan review required?

Site Plan Review is required in these situations:


- Any new construction, building addition or use enlargement or exterior renovation of an existing structure in the NDO, LNC, NDI, UNC, or P zoning district on a lot of 2,400 sq. ft. or larger
- Any new construction or building addition, enlargement, or exterior renovation of an existing structure in the HC, UI, or GI district on a lot of 8,000 sq. ft. or larger
- Any off-street parking area in the NDO, NDI, LNC, UNC, UI, or P zoning districts that includes more than 10 parking spaces or more than 2,500 sq. ft. of surface area
- Any construction (including additions and rehabilitations) in the H zoning district
- Any new construction, enlargement or renovation of a multi-unit residence of 4 or more units
- Any development requiring Site Plan Review listed inSection 911.04 - Use Standards
- Any development subject to Residential Compatibility Standards inSection 916
- Development meeting the Site Plan Review threshold for the RIV zoning district found inSection 905.04.C.1
Properties without a validCertificate of Occupancymay also be subject to Site Plan Review.

Is there a public hearing for site plan review projects?

A public notice will be required if the proposal includes a request that qualifies for anAdministrator Exception.
A public hearing at theZoning Board of Adjustment (ZBA)will be required if the proposal includes:


- Any request that requires a Special Exception
- Any request that requires a Variance from any of the Zoning Code requirements
During Site Plan Review, Zoning staff will identify any Special Exception and/or Variance requests that the project would need from the ZBA in order to be approved as proposed. The applicant may choose to revise the proposal to bring the project into compliance with the Zoning Code requirements instead of proceeding with the public hearing.

Is there a fee for site plan review?

Yes. The fee for the Site Plan Review component is $750. Additional fees may apply for other applicable components (see theFee Schedulefor more information).

What are the submission requirements?

The Site Plan Review application package must include:


- Zoning and Development Review Application form (completed and signed), or submitted online atOneStopPGH
- Site Plan
- Landscape plan with materials labeled
- Other documentation as required depending on the scope and/or location of the project

What other information is needed for site plan review?

Depending on the scope of work and location of the site, additional documentation may be required. Zoning staff will help identify what these will be. Commonly required items include:


- Complete Design Review submission
- Grading plan
- Geotechnical Report
- Stormwater Management Plan
- Construction Management Plan
- Roof plan and screening illustrations for HVAC
- Other drawings or documents as required for specific projects to fully demonstrate the scope of work and how it complies with the Zoning Code

What needs to be shown on the site plan?

Site plans must include, as a minimum, the following information:


- Name of property owner
- Date of preparation
- Location and dimensions of all existing and proposed property lines
- Locations and dimensions of all applicable utilities and other easements
- North arrow
- Width and name of all streets and ways
- Locations, dimensions and heights of all existing and proposed structures, parking, and driveways, and any other features on the property
- Landscaping, screening and street trees
- Depending on the scope of work, additional information may be required as requested

Are professional drawings required?

All projects must meet site plan requirements, as outlined above. Additionally, the site plan or survey for all Zoning Site Plans must be professionally stamped, with exceptions as listed in the Process Guide forSite Plans Requirements. Professionals may include an architect, surveyor or engineer.
Zoning staff will make the final determination whether or not a project requires professionally stamped drawings.
Landscape plans should be stamped by a landscape architect.
Grading plans, geotechnical reports and stormwater management plans should be stamped by engineers certified in these fields.
Zoning staff will make the final determination whether or not a project requires professionally stamped drawings.

What other reviews may be required?

Depending on the scope of work and location, any of the additionalPlanning Reviews, Public Notices, and Public Hearingsmay apply. The most common ones are Design Review, Historic Review, and the Environmental Reviews.

What is the first step to apply for site plan review?

To begin the Site Plan Review process, please file a Zoning and Development Review Application and drawings, both of which may be submitted through theOneStopPGH online portal. A $50 filing fee is required to submit the application, paid via credit card or e-check (a service charge will apply). Hard copy applications and checks may still be mailed or dropped off at the OneStopPGH Counter, 200 Ross St, Suite 320, Pittsburgh, PA 15219, open daily from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m. If hard copy drawings are filed, please note that the largest size we can accept is 11” x 17”.
If you are already working with Zoning staff, including at a pre-application meeting, email the Zoning and Development Rewview number to that staff member after the application was submitted. Otherwise, a staff member will be assigned to your application and will follow up as the review progresses.

How long will the process take?

Once a complete application is submitted, expect a reply from staff with initial review comments within 30 days. Review results include more information required, revisions requested or approved. Other required components may be running concurrently, but have different response times and outcomes.

When is the site plan review completed?

The Record of Zoning Approval (ROZA) will be issued once a project complies with all applicable Zoning Code requirements, has successfully completed all required components, and paid all applicable fees. At that time, staff will email the ROZA. A ROZA is required to submit for a building permit (if required) with the Department of Permits Licenses and Inspections.

Site Plan Requirements


What is a site plan?

A site plan (also named plot plan or survey) is a plan of the entire property, drawn to scale, that shows the location and dimensions of all property lines, any existing and proposed structures, and any proposed exterior work.

Why is a site plan required?

Anytime a structure or use is added to a property (such as fence, shed, parking, addition, house, chicken coop, etc.) an accurate site plan or professional survey is required to determine if the project meets all Zoning Code requirements. Site plans are subject toZoning Review.

Is a professional stamped plan required?

Yes, most projects must be submitted on a professionally stamped site plan completed by an architect, surveyor or engineer, except fences, residential HVAC/generators, chicken coop, and wall signs. If there is conflicting data about the location of a property line, a surveyor’s stamp will be required. Zoning staff will make the final determination of whether or not a project requires a professional survey.

Can an existing survey be used?

Existing stamped surveys showing current conditions can be used, as long as the proposed work is drawn to scale.
If a prior application included a survey or site plan, that plan may be on file at the Division of Zoning and Development Review. To find out if Zoning has a suitable copy of a site plan or survey of a property, emailzoning@pittsburghpa.gov.

Can the applicant draw the site plan?

Yes, when the applicant knows where the property lines are and is applying for residential HVAC/generators, wall signs, or a fence no taller than 6 1/2 feet. Fences and the public sidewalk are not neccesarily installed on the property line and therefore cannot be used to determine where a property line is. If the applicant does not know where the property line is, then they will have to hire a licensed professional.
Note:Allegheny County Real Estate website maps and Google satellite maps are not accurate enough to meet the site plan requirement.

What are the steps to draw a site plan?

Anyone can draw a site plan with the right tools and information.

Step 1

Get all the measurements: property line dimensions, building dimensions, accessory structure dimensions, and all distances between the structures and the property lines. TheAllegheny County Real Estate websitehas the dimensions of property lines (maps tab) and most houses (image tab).

Step 2

Draw the site plan. Most residential properties will fit on an 8 1/2” x 11” piece of paper. Zoning cannot accept any plans on paper larger than 11” x 17”.
Select the scale for the plan. It must be a standard architect’s or engineer’s scale. A regular ruler can use the scale 1 inch equals 16 feet (1”=16’). This means that every inch as measured on the plan is the equivalent to 16 feet on the property.
Each inch on the ruler is divided into 16 lines, so each line represents 1 foot. If the lot is 100 feet long, count 100 lines on a ruler and draw a line that long on the paper.
Once the property line is drawn, add the house and all accessory structures using the measurements gathered and at 1”=16’, counting one line on the ruler for every foot measured.

Step 3

Add details to the plan. The plan must also show:


- Name of the property owner
- Names of all streets, ways or alleys around the property
- Street address of the property
- Arrow indicating north
- Scale
- Labeled measurements of all property lines and structures
- Labeled distance of all structures from the property lines

Certificate of Occupancy


When is a Certificate of Occupancy Required?

The Certificate of Occupancy issued for a property documents how that specific property is legally allowed to be used and that the use met the Zoning Code, Historic Preservation Code (if applicable), and Building Code regulations administered by the City of Pittsburgh at the time of issuance.
A Certificate of Occupancy, also known as an Occupancy Permit, shall be required for the lawful use or occupancy of all land, structures or premises, including accessory uses such as parking, fences and sheds. A valid Certificate of Occupancy is required to obtain most construction permits, including building, sign, and HVAC permits.
Anytime a change in use occurs,Zoning Reviewand review by the Department of Permits, Licenses, and Inspections is required. If approved, a new Certificate of Occupancy will be issued.

How to Obtain a Certificate of Occupancy


Verify whether or not a property has a valid Certificate of Occupancy

Permits, Licenses and Inspections maintains copies of all Certificates of Occupancy ever issued for all properties in the City of Pittsburgh.


- Check theonline Certificate of Occupancy searchmaintained by PLI.
- Be sure to search for any alternate or previous addresses available as some buildings have multiple addresses or the address may have changed over time.
- The most recent Certificate of Occupancy for any portion of the building or site is the applicable Certificate of Occupancy for that portion.
For example a multi-story mixed-use building at 123 E. Main St. has a Certificate of Occupancy for use of Retail Sales and Services on the 1st floor issued in 1982 and a Certificate of Occupancy for use of Office on the 2nd floor issued in 2008. No other Certificates of Occupancy have been issued since, so these are the current Certificates for this site.
If there is not a Certificate of Occupancy on file that exactly matches the current use of the property or if you do not have a valid Certificate of Occupancy, you must apply for one through the Zoning Division and PLI.
For example: if the property above (123 E. Main St.) currently has a Restaurant on the 1st floor, then there isn’t a valid Certificate of Occupancy for the use and a new one must be requested.

Apply for a Certificate of Occupancy

Follow the requirements for the applicableZoning Reviewprocess.


- A stamped and sealed survey or site plan is required for any application that includes parking or new construction of or addition to a primary (or main) structure.
- A hand-drawn plot plan may be acceptable for other applications. SeeSurvey Requirements websitefor more information.
Please note that some projects may require approval from theDepartment of Mobility and Infrastructureif they include work in the right-of-way (such as a curb cut for new parking, a sidewalk café, or an entrance ramp encroaching in the right-of-way).

Complete Application at PLI

Once the Zoning Review has been approved, the applicant will submit to PLI for their review and approval.

What is a Temporary Certificate of Occupancy?

A temporary Certificate of Occupancy is required when an applicant wishes to partially occupy a construction project before the final inspection is signed-off or an event is occupying a building or parcel for a short time. All applications for a temporary occupancy require review and approval by the Division of Zoning and Development Review and PLI. Applications for a temporary event also require review by the Office of Special Events, emailspecialevents@pittsburghpa.govto coordinate that review.
Approval for a temporary occupancy may be granted for up to 6 months. If the applicant wishes to extend the time on a temporary occupancy about to expire, then a new temporary occupancy application is required, subject to all applicable fees.

Administrator Exception


What is an administrator exception?

An Administrator Exception is a component of the Zoning Review that requires public notice. It is required by the Zoning Code based on the project location and scope of work for certain requests that are allowed by right, provided they will not be injurious to surrounding property as demonstrated through compliance to specific standards in the Zoning Code.

When is an administrator exception required?

The Administrator Exception requests are either dimensional requests related to a use or structure, or based on the proposed use in that specific Zoning District. Common residential dimensional requests are for accessory structures and/or uses such as decks or parking stalls in the side or rear yard, if these are no closer to the front or neighboring property line than the existing, legally established, primary structure.

Who initiates an administrator exception?

Zoning staff will determine if the proposed scope of work requires an Administrator Exception during theZoning Reviewof aZoning Development Review application. Once the applicant has provided staff with evidence of compliance with the applicable Administrator Exception standards and paid the Administrator Exception fee, staff will prepare the public notice poster for the applicant to post at the project site.

What is needed for evidence of compliance with applicable administrator exception standards?

This will vary by project and type of Administrator Exception, such as a residential dimensional request or a commercial request based on proposed use. For commercial applications, please consult the zoning staff reviewing the project. For residential dimensional applications, such as accessory structures and/or uses in the side or rear yard, staff will typically request an accurate site plan, and a letter from the impacted adjacent property owner stating that they do not have significant concerns regarding the proposal.

What is the administrator exception fee?

The fee for the Administrator Exception component of an application is $100. Other review fees will apply for the complete application (see theFee Schedulefor more information).

What is the posted notice requirement?

The City-provided notice must be posted for at least 21 days on the subject property in a location where it is legible from the primary adjacent public right-of-way. The poster indicates the date and nature of the Administrator Exception.
On the day of posting, the applicant must take a photo of the poster and the site context as evidence that the posted notice requirements summarized above are met. (See Section 922.01.C.2 for more details.) Please upload your photos using theOneStopPGH online portal, or email or deliver the photos to the Zoning staff person reviewing the application. The 21-day count will begin when Zoning staff receives the photo and verifies compliance with the posted notice requirements.

What is required after the 21-day posted notice period?

After the 21-day posted notice period, the applicant must continue to work with Zoning staff to complete the applicableZoning Review. If the project is in Basic Zoning Review and all other Zoning requirements have been met, the staff will email the applicant with the Record of Zoning Approval (ROZA). If the project is in Site Plan Review or Zoning Review with Planning Commission, the applicant must continue coordinating with the assigned staff reviewer on any outstanding components.

Does an administrator exception expire?

An Administrator Exception expires one year after being granted. A permit should be obtained and substantial construction or occupancy should begin within one year of approval. If additional time is needed, the applicant may request a one-year extension by writing to the Zoning Administrator within the one-year time period. Include the address of the subject property with a brief explanation on why an extension is needed.

May a neighbor appeal an administrator exception?

Yes, affected parties may appeal an Administrator Exception within 30 days of the approval. Appeals are heard by theZoning Board of Adjustment (ZBA).

Are administrator exception files public?

Yes, the applications and drawings are available upon request to the Zoning Staff. Please email the Zoning staff person reviewing the application orzoning@pittsburghpa.gov. Please include the address and the parcel ID (if known) and the case number (if known). The Zoning Office is currently closed to the public.

Posting the Notice Placard

The notice will need to be posted on the property in a conspicuous place, plainly visible for public viewing from the right of way. If the notice must be posted outside, please take the proper steps to ensure the poster is weather resistant. Failure to post and maintain this placard will result in a delay of the hearing until these regulations are complied with.
See the following recommended location examples:

Photographing the Notice

To document that the Notice has been posted correctly please photograph it then email that photograph to your project reviewer using the contact information listed below.
The photograph of the Notice should clearly show the property and location of the Notice on the property. Once this photograph has been received your project reviewer will begin the 21-day notice period.
Your project reviewer will contact you when the 21-day posting period has ended and you can remove the Notice.

Design Review

Design review is an important part of the permitting process in the Department of City Planning. Architects and developers work with staff to help ensure high-quality development in Pittsburgh. Successful design improves quality of life, enhances neighborhood character, and provides economic and environmental benefits.

Projects That Require Design Review

Pittsburgh's Zoning Code requires design review for many types of projects, based on size and zoning district. All projects requiring Site Plan Review and a Development Review Application must undergo design review. Specifically, these projects include:


- New and renovated commercial construction
- New residential construction of four or more units
- Projects which require Site Plan Review, Project Development Plan review, and Final Land Development Plans
- Projects located Downtown
- Projects required by the Zoning Code or the Zoning Administrator

Design Review Process

Applicants should begin the design review process at an early stage of project development when changes in the project can still be made. To begin, applicants complete a Building and Development Application (BDA) on OneStopPGH. Applicants can also set up a pre-application meeting on OneStopPGH with zoning and design staff to discuss the project and approval process. The extent of the design review process can vary depending on the scale and scope of the project, necessary review, and what urban design issues or criteria are present in the project.

Reference Material

Your proposed project may have design guidelines or review criteria as part of an adopted Neighborhood Plan or Zoning District:


- If your project is located in aSP Zoning District, see here for more information
- If your project is located in a EMI Zoning District, see here for the associatedInstitutional Master Plan
- See here for recently completedNeighborhood Master Plans
- For projects which require Site Plan Review, see here for Review Criteria (Section 922.04.E)
- For projects located in UC-MU, UC-E, and R-MU, see here for Review Criteria (Section 922.15)

Submission Requirements

The materials required to start design review depend on the scope and size of the project. For example, exterior alterations of an existing building may not require perspectives or renderings. Please submit as much as possible of the following items with your application on OneStopPGH:


- Written Project Summary
- Site Location Map (showing a neighborhood block scale)
- Site Context Plan (showing neighboring properties, structures, street names)
- Site Plan
- Photos of surrounding context with labels
- Building elevations with existing and proposed materials labeled
- Landscaping plan with proposed materials and species labeled
- Furnishings and Site Amenities
- Perspectives and renderings showing the proposed project in context
- Sidewalk level perspectives
- Massing studies

Staff Design Review Process

All Design Review starts at the staff level. After a OneStopPGH application is filed, City Planning design review staff and the neighborhood planner make an initial evaluation of the project using information submitted by the applicant. During this initial review, City Planning design review staff develops a list ofUrban Design Targetsfor the project. The goals are specific to the project but are broad, non-prescriptive, and serve as a checklist for the applicant.Urban Design Targetsguide the project throughout the review process, although a project may meet some of the goals on initial submission. In developing each set of targets, staff draws from relevant master plans and design guidelines.
At this stage, City Planning design staff determines what type of further design review is necessary, either staff design review or the Contextual Design Advisory Panel (CDAP) review. If CDAP review is recommended, seeadditional information about the Contextual Design Advisory Panel.
If a project continues with staff review, the project representative meets with staff and works to address the project's urban design targets. The process is complete when the applicant has met all the design-related zoning requirements and addressed the urban design targets to the fullest extent possible.

Environmental Review

Due to Pittsburgh’s history and unique terrain, the City has several environmental conditions that can be impacted by developments, ranging from fences to new skyscrapers. These environmental conditions include steep slopes, landslide prone soils, undermined areas due to former coal mine activities, and floodplains.
To ensure that these conditions do not negatively impact proposed developments, projects may be subject to stormwater management plan review, floodplain review and/or geotechnical report review.
Learn more about stormwater review, floodplain review and geotechnical report review and check out theInteractive Zoning Mapto learn what environmental factors may impact a specific location.

Floodplain


What is the floodplain overlay?

The City of Pittsburgh participates in theNational Flood Insurance Program, a federal program though theFederal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). Through the National Flood Insurance Plan, the City agrees to manage development in the floodway and floodplain, which is any land area susceptible to being inundated by floodwaters.
Both the City and residents benefit from this participation. The primary benefit for residents is the ability to purchase flood insurance, which most homeowner and renter insurance policies do not cover. To maintain these benefits, the City must adopt and enforce floodplain management regulations that meet state and federal standards.

Where are the floodplain regulations?

The National Flood Insurance Plan requires municipalities participating in the program to adopt floodplain regulations that meet state and federal standards. In Pittsburgh, these regulations are located in the Zoning Code, in Section 906.02 "Flood Plain Overlay District" of theMunicipal Code.

How do I determine if my property is in the floodplain or floodway?

Both FEMA and the City of Pittsburgh have maps online and houses may be searched by address.


- FEMA Flood Map, searchable by address.
- Pittsburgh Zoning Floodplain MapTo use the Pittsburgh map, click on “layers” at the top of the map and turn on “Current - 1% Chance Annual Flood”.It may be helpful to turn other layers off, the color is a light pink.All of the properties located in the "Current - 1% Chance Annual Flood" are subject to the Pittsburgh Flood Plain Overlay.


    * To use the Pittsburgh map, click on “layers” at the top of the map and turn on “Current - 1% Chance Annual Flood”.
    * It may be helpful to turn other layers off, the color is a light pink.
    * All of the properties located in the "Current - 1% Chance Annual Flood" are subject to the Pittsburgh Flood Plain Overlay.

Frequently Used Terms



- AFlood Insurance Rate Mapis created by the National Flood Insurance Plan and generally shows a community’s base flood elevations, flood zones and floodplain boundaries.
- TheSpecial Flood Hazard Areais the land in the floodway and floodplain at high risk of flooding. These areas are indicated on Flood Insurance Rate Maps as “A, AE, or AE Floodway” and are subject to the regulations of the Pittsburgh Flood Plain Overlay.
- Afloodplainis the land which is subject to flooding from an adjacent watercourse or any area subject to unusual or rapid accumulation of surface waters from any source.
- Afloodwayconsists of the actual waterway as well as any adjacent lands that must be reserved in order to alleviate the 1% annual flood without increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot.
- Base flood elevationis the projected height of the water in the 1% chance annual flood.

My property is in the floodplain or floodway. What does that mean to me?

FEMA has determined that properties mapped as Special Flood Hazard Area have a 1 percent annual chance of flooding. These areas are marked as “A, AE, or AE Floodway” FEMA maps. Please note that FEMA also maps the 2 percent annual chance of flooding, but this is not regulated by Pittsburgh Flood Plain Overlay.
For property owners in the existing and newly mapped Special Flood Hazard Areas, insurers may require flood insurance and different building and development standards will apply. No building or site changes will be required to existing development sites with valid certificates of occupancy, so long as no changes or alterations are made.

New Construction: What different building and development standards apply in the floodplain?

All new construction in the floodplain will be required to be in full compliance with the current regulations. Generally, all new construction (commerical and residential) will be required to be flood proofed or elevated 18” above the base flood elevation.

Existing Development: What different building and development standards apply in the floodplain?

Improvements are permitted to existing structures. For work that costs less than 50 percent of the value of the structure, no additional requirements are triggered. Work that costs more than 50 percent of the value of the structure is termed a substantial improvement and the structure must come into compliance with the ordinance.

What is flood insurance and do I need it?

Most homeowners insurance does not cover flood damage. Flood insurance is not a governmental requirement or regulation, but it may be required by your mortgage lender. If you live in a Special Flood Hazard Area or high-risk area and have a federally backed mortgage, your insurer will require a policy. Renters may also purchase insurance.

My property is not in the mapped floodplain. Can I buy flood insurance?

Yes, anyone may purchase flood insurance, both renters and owners.

How do I obtain Flood Insurance?

To obtain flood insurance, please talk to your local insurance agent or visit theNational Flood Insurance Program website.

What if I feel my property is not in the floodplain, even though it is mapped within one?

The City of Pittsburgh does not have the ability to remove properties from the FEMA floodplain maps. If you believe your property was incorrectly included in the Special Flood Hazard Area, you may submit an application to FEMA for a formal determination of the property's location and/or elevation relative to the Special Flood Hazard Area.Online Letter of Map Change guidelinesare available online.

Why do I need to complete the floodplain application?

As part of the National Flood Insurance Plan, and to maintain benefits for residents, Pittsburgh is required to document the review process for all land development in the floodplain and floodway. This includes items like paving and outdoor storage that previously may not have needed a permit from the Zoning Division or the Department of Permits, Licenses and Inspections.

Geotechnical Reports


What is a geotechnical report?

Geotechnical reports indicate whether a particular site is suitable for the construction of a permanent or temporary structure. Geotechnical reports assess the safety of the proposed construction by indicating whether the soil and other geological conditions of the site will provide the necessary support for the development. A geotechnical report may be required before the construction of buildings, walls, roads and other structures.
Please note:As part of the geotechnical report, a subsurface investigation is required, which will include borings on the site, and may require heavy equipment on the site.

When is a geotechnical report required?

The applicant must submit a geotechnical report in the three situations described below.
- Landslide-Prone Overlay (Zoning Code §906.04):Any application for new construction or for a multi-story addition, must submit a full geotechnical reportAny application for a parking pad, deck, porch, stoop, balcony, retaining wall or one story addition, must submit evidence from a certified geotechnical professional that the proposal will not increase the susceptibility of landslides on the subject property or surrounding property


    * Any application for new construction or for a multi-story addition, must submit a full geotechnical report
    * Any application for a parking pad, deck, porch, stoop, balcony, retaining wall or one story addition, must submit evidence from a certified geotechnical professional that the proposal will not increase the susceptibility of landslides on the subject property or surrounding property
- Undermined Area Overlay (Zoning Code §906.5):Any application that includes new construction or an enlargement of an existing structure in the Undermined Overlay must submit a Coal Status Report with maps from the State Bureau of Mines. The Coal Status Report may be requested for a specific property address or parcel ID by emailingep-csr@pa.govor calling 724-769-1100For single family dwellings, a geotechnical report is required only if the Coal Status Report shows less than 100 ft of overburdenFor all other new construction or enlargement of existing structures, a geotechnical report is required regardless of the amount of overburden


    * Any application that includes new construction or an enlargement of an existing structure in the Undermined Overlay must submit a Coal Status Report with maps from the State Bureau of Mines. The Coal Status Report may be requested for a specific property address or parcel ID by emailingep-csr@pa.govor calling 724-769-1100
    * For single family dwellings, a geotechnical report is required only if the Coal Status Report shows less than 100 ft of overburden
    * For all other new construction or enlargement of existing structures, a geotechnical report is required regardless of the amount of overburden
- Steep Slopes (Zoning Code §915.02.A.1):Cut or filled slopes shall not exceed 25% unless the applicant submits a geotechnical report that certifies the safety and suitability of such slopes


    * Cut or filled slopes shall not exceed 25% unless the applicant submits a geotechnical report that certifies the safety and suitability of such slopes

When is a geotechnical report not required?

Typically if you have a smaller project with little or no impact to the soils, a geotechnical report may not be needed. This is not an exhaustive list, but it provides examples of construction in which a geotechnical report may not be required:


- Installation of fences no taller than 6 feet
- Project has no impact to the site (i.e. interior renovations, etc.)
- Deck renovation with no change to the posts or structure
- Sheds less than 120 sq ft
- Exterior repair of an existing structure when there is no alteration to the building envelop
If any of the above items will change the slope or are located near the edge of the slope, the applicant will need to submit evidence from a certified geotechnical professional that the proposal can be safely accomplished.
If you have an existing approved geotechnical report and your proposed project is not increasing the impact to the soil and other geological conditions, the existing, approved geotechnical report may be valid for the new proposal.

What is required in the geotechnical report?

The report will include written and graphic summary of the subsurface investigation, conclusions or assessment from that investigation, and recommendations for the proposed project. The following items must be included in all geotechnical reports:


- Field Investigation with site plan
- Subsurface InvestigationNote: These subsurface investigation should detail any findings and should include a map that illustrates the investigation. Include site photos if possible.


    * Note: These subsurface investigation should detail any findings and should include a map that illustrates the investigation. Include site photos if possible.
- Recommendations for the project/scope of work
- Site plan with landslide prone area overlay, undermined area overlay, and steep slope contours shown (as applicable)
- Demolition plan (as applicable)
- Grading plan
- Professional signature and sealed with liability insurance information

Who can create a geotechnical report?

Professionals with credentials and who carry liability insurance (individually or as a professional group) may produce a geotechnical report. These include:


- Soil Engineers
- Professional Civil Engineers
- Geotechnical Engineers
- Professional or Engineering Geologists

Who reviews the geotechnical report?

Geotechnical reports are reviewed by the Department of City Planning and by the Department of Permits, Licenses, and Inspections.
Planning staff will evaluate it for completeness during the site plan review. Department of Permits, Licenses and Inspections staff will review it with the building permit(s) to ensure that the recommendations and assessments are consistent with the drawings submitted.

Construction Management Plans


What is a construction management plan for development review?

A Construction Management Plan (CMP) documents how the construction operation will be handled in order to identify and mitigate any potential negative impacts early in the development review process.

When is a construction management plan required?

A CMP is required as part of the Zoning Review process for the following development types:


- Any new construction operation that includes a structure or multiple structures totaling more than 200,000 sq. ft. of floor area
- Any new construction operation that includes a structure or group of structures subject to Residential Compatibility Standards and that include more than 50,000 sq. ft. of floor area
- Any construction operation including new construction or exterior renovation on a lot size greater than 2,400 sq. ft. where the existing or proposed building occupies 90% or more of the lot
- Any development proposal that the Zoning Administrator determines may have significant impacts in the construction phase

What needs to be included in a construction management plan?

A CMP includes two key components: the scope with details and the mitigation measures.
The scope and details portion describes the operational aspects of the proposed construction work and shall include the following information:


- Transportation routing (pedestrians, bicycles and cars)
- Street and sidewalk closures and/or obstructions
- Construction circulation
- Debris/dumpster maintenance
- Work crew parking
- Site maintenance
- Duration of construction
- Any other relevant information
The mitigation portion shall explain the impacts of the proposed construction operations and will describe or show the proposed measures to reduce these impacts. These measures may include sound barriers, temporary sidewalks and sidewalk protection, dust and debris management, and construction safety plans.
The mitigation measures shall address the following topics:


- Construction noise
- Traffic
- Parking
- Air
- Light
- Any other relevant areas of potential impact
Please note that the CMP will work in conjunction with any other existing review processes or requirements including, but not limited to, the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure’s requirements for street/sidewalk closure permits or MPT plans. Please contact DOMI for more information on these requirements.

When does a construction management plan get submitted?

A CMP should be submitted along with the Zoning and Development Review application, site plan, and other required documents as part of theSite Plan Reviewor Zoning Review withPlanning Commissionsubmission. Please note that for projects requiring Planning Commission approval, a summary of the CMP must be included as a slide in the presentation for Planning Commission.
Minor modifications and additional details may be added to the CMP during the building permit review phase, provided it is substantially similar to the original CMP approved during the Zoning Review.

When do I talk to the neighborhood?

The Department of City Planning encourages all applicants for any development to discuss their pending projects with their neighbors, neighborhood groups and their Council representative as early as possible.

Why is a construction management plan required as part of the planning approval?

In order to facilitate multi-department review, the CMP is required as part of theZoning Reviewprocess to help the applicant identify potential impacts that the construction and staging may have on the neighboring residents and businesses. The CMP review will identify needed approvals for the construction of the project, such as street and sidewalk closures, temporary occupancy or other approvals.
For projects requiring Planning Commission approval, the CMP allows the public to review and the Commission to contribute to the solutions presented in the CMP.

Who reviews construction management plans?

CMPs are reviewed by the Department of City Planning, the Department of Mobility and Infrastructure and the Department of Permits, Licenses, and Inspections. Once the CMP has been submitted with the Zoning application, Zoning staff will coordinate the review of the CMP with the other departments.

What is my project does not yet have a general contractor?

If a project is required to have a CMP as part of the Zoning Review process, the project architect, engineer or other lead professional can draft the CMP for initial review. It must include the scope of work with details and the mitigation measures, as described above, based on the knowledge and experience of the project professional.
Once a general contractor is brought into the team, modifications and additional details may be added to the CMP during the building permit review phase, provided it is substantially similar to the original CMP approved during the Zoning Review.

What do I include in the planning commission presentation?

Please summarize the following information from the CMP based on the project scope:


- Transportation routing (pedestrians, bicycles and cars)
- Street and sidewalk closures and/or obstructions
- Construction circulation
- Debris/dumpster maintenance
- Work crew parking
- Site maintenance
- Duration of construction
- Other relevant information
- The mitigation efforts
Details do not need to be finalized, but enough information needs to be presented for Planning Commission and the public to understand the impacts.

Housing

The City of Pittsburgh is committed to implementing policies thatpromote,produce, andpreserveaffordable housing options throughout the City that are safe, healthy and let all residents thrive.

Policy


Inclusionary Zoning

Inclusionary Zoning (IZ) ensures that neighborhoods can offer new housing units by tying the construction of affordable housing to that of market-rate housing. It is used in a variety of cities across the country, and was identified by the City’s Affordable Housing Task Force (AHTF, 2016) as a tool that could work here in Pittsburgh to address the shortage of affordable units.


- Inclusionary Zoning applies to new construction or major renovation of projects that include 20 or more residential units for sale or for rent
- Projects that meet the size threshold would need to price 10% of units affordably (rounding up if a fraction)
- Currently, the Inclusionary Zoning ordinance is applicable in Lawrenceville, Bloomfield, Polish Hill, and Oakland (excluding the EMI Zoning District).

What do you mean by “affordable”?Rent or sale prices are based at certain percentages of the Area Median Income (AMI), which is defined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Department and varies by household size. For-rent inclusionary units will be set aside for households earning no more than 50% of AMI. For-sale inclusionary units, will be set aside for households earning no more than 80% of AMI. Inclusionary units will be priced at no more than 30% of income, based on these AMI standards. For example, using these pricing standards, a two-bedroom unit would rent for no more than $855, and a two-bedroom home would be listed for sale at no more than $128,000.
Where has the Inclusionary Zoning ordinance been adopted?Currently, the Inclusionary Zoning ordinance is applicable in Lawrenceville, Bloomfield, and Polish Hill.
