ARTICLE IV 
DETERMINATION OF TAX BASE 
Section 401. — Inclusions. 
The tax is imposed on every person engaging in any Institutional or non-profit Service 
in the City of Pittsburgh.  The tax is not imposed on Exempt Institutions.   
Section 402.  –   Pittsburgh Receipts. 
(a)
General.  Except for receipts associated with interstate commerce,
receipts from any transaction shall be attributable to Pittsburgh, if any event forming a 
part of the transaction occurs within Pittsburgh or the taxpayer’s only office is located 
within the City and the Service is offered from a Pittsburgh location. 
(b)
Any receipts arising from Institutional on non-profit service to the general
public or any select or limited number thereof, is taxable if a charge is made.  Intrastate 
receipts from services which are the result of business activities carried on through a 
branch office located outside Pittsburgh, are taxable if such services are performed in 
Pittsburgh if the service is offered from the City. 
(c)
Persons engaging in any Institutional or non-profit service be it
professional, commercial, or personal services, are subject to the tax. If a person 
engaging in any Institutional or non-profit service only maintains a place of business in 
the City of Pittsburgh, the entire receipts from intrastate activity in the Commonwealth 
from personal services must be included in the measure of the tax, whether or not the 
services are performed in Pittsburgh. Receipts will be deemed attributable to Pittsburgh, 
if they result from the efforts of employees who work in, or from or are attached to 
taxpayer's Pittsburgh place of business.  If any taxpayer is subject to Privilege tax in two 
or more jurisdictions in Pennsylvania, he may request a ruling from the Treasurer to 
address the issue of potential double taxation.  
(d)
Receipts associated with interstate commerce shall be apportioned to
the City by multiplying total receipts earned everywhere times the City Apportionment 
percentage.  The City Apportionment percentage is the sum of the following three 
apportionment factors:  Payroll Percentage factor, Property Percentage factor, and 
Sales Percentage factor, divided by three. If one of the percentage factors is zero, the 
denominator shall be two.  If two of the percentage factors are zero, the dominator shall 
be one.  In no event can a percentage factor be less than zero. 
(1)
The Payroll Percentage factor shall be payroll reported by the
taxpayer subject to City local earned income tax divided by total payroll reported on 
Federal Form 940.  If the taxpayer only has one office in the Commonwealth and that 
office is in the City, the numerator of the Payroll percentage factor shall be total payroll 
reported to the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue. 
(2)
The Property Percentage factor shall be the sum of tangible
property located in the City divided by the sum of tangible property located everywhere 
in the United States, determined as of December 31.  Property shall be recorded at its 
original cost before any depreciation, amortization, or cost depletion.  Leased property 

-14-
shall be recorded as an item of tangible property at eight (8) times annual rent for the 
leased property.  Movable property is in the City if it is in the City on December 31 of 
the calendar year.  If the taxpayer only has one office in the Commonwealth and that 
office is in the City, the numerator of the Property percentage factor shall be sum of 
tangible property located in the Commonwealth. 
(3)
The Sales Percentage factor shall be gross receipts from
Services provided in the City or offered from a City location divided by gross receipts 
everywhere.  If additional guidance is required with regard to the definition of Sales, 
the taxpayer shall follow the practice of the Pennsylvania Department of Revenue 
under the Corporate Net Income Tax provisions of the Tax Reform Act, 72 P.S. § 7401, 
so long as such practice is not inconsistent with the purposes of the Privilege Tax. 
(4)
A taxpayer is engaged in interstate commerce if it is subject to tax
in another jurisdiction, outside the Commonwealth, on its net income or on its gross 
receipts.  A taxpayer can show it is subject to tax in another jurisdiction by providing 
copies of tax returns filed with taxing jurisdictions outside the Commonwealth.  If 
intrastate receipts are co-mingled with interstate activity, all receipts shall be 
considered interstate receipts. 
(5)
If the application of the City apportionment percentage results in
the same gross receipts of the Taxpayer being taxable, for gross receipts or privilege 
tax purposes, by two or more jurisdictions in the United States, the Taxpayer may 
approach the Treasurer for a ruling to avoid this double taxation, such as receiving a 
credit for gross receipts or privilege taxes paid elsewhere, or by a modification of the 
City apportionment percentage.  No credit will be granted by the City for net income 
taxes, excise taxes, or transaction taxes paid to another jurisdiction. 

-15-
ARTICLE V 
SUITS FOR COLLECTION, PENALTIES, ETC. 
Section 501. — Suits for Recovery of Unpaid Taxes. 
(a)
The following periods of limitations shall apply to suits for collection of
taxes. 
(1)
When a return has been filed but no tax paid, any suit brought to
recover the tax due and unpaid shall be filed within three (3) years after the return was 
due or filed, whichever is later. Where no return was filed, there shall be no limit to file 
suit for the collection of taxes. 
(2)
In the case of a deficiency assessment, suit shall be filed within
three (3) years after the assessment has been made. 
(b)
The limitations set forth in paragraph (a) shall not prevent the institution
of a suit for the collection of any tax due or determined to be due in the following cases: 
(1)
When no return was filed, there is no limitation.
(2)
When the return is fraudulent, there is no limitation.
(3)
When there is an understatement of tax liability of twenty-five
(25%) or more, and not due to fraud, suit must be begun within six (6) years. 
(4)
A return filed before the due date is deemed to be filed on the due
date. 
Section 502. — Penalty and Interest for Non-payment. 
(a)
If, however, any Taxpayer shall fail to make any report and payment as
herein required a penalty at the rate of one-half of one percent (0.5%) per month for 
each month or a fraction of a whole month on the amount of tax and interest of one 
(1%) percent per month for each month or fraction of a whole month during the period 
in which the tax remains unpaid shall be added to the tax.  In no event shall the 
interest rate assessed exceed the maximum rate allowed by the Municipal Claims and 
Tax Liens Act, 53 P.S. §7143, or applicable law. 
(b)
There is no limit or cut off point, for applying penalty and interest.
(c)
On any additional tax determined to be due as a result of a deficiency
assessment, penalty and interest will be assessed from the day the tax should have 
been paid to the date of payment.  Penalty and interest is calculated as described 
above. 
(d)
Where suit is brought for the recovery of such tax, the person liable
therefore shall, in addition, be liable for the costs of collection and the interest and 
penalties herein imposed. Once due and owing, penalty and interest become part of 
the tax and shall be collected as such. A person’s belief that no tax is due and owing, 
or the failure of any person to receive or obtain the forms required for making the 
returns required under the City Code is not a valid defense to the imposition of penalties 
herein for violation.  Good faith shall not be a defense to the imposition of penalty. 

-16-
Section 503. – Fines and Penalties for Violation of Act. 
(a)
Whoever willfully makes any false or untrue statement on the return shall,
upon summary conviction thereof, be sentenced to pay a fine of not more than five 
hundred dollars ($500.00) or to undergo imprisonment for not more than thirty (30) 
days. 
(b)
Whoever willfully fails or refuses to appear before the Treasurer, in
person with his books, records or accounts for examination when required under the 
provisions of the Institution and Service Privilege Tax Ordinance, to do so, or who 
willfully refuses to permit inspection of the books, records or accounts of any services 
in custody or control, when the right to make such inspection by the Treasurer is 
requested, shall upon summary conviction thereof, be sentenced to pay a fine of not 
more than Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00), or to undergo imprisonment for not more 
than thirty (30) days. 
(c)
Whoever willfully fails or refuses to file a return required by the Institution
and Service Privilege Tax Ordinance, shall, upon summary conviction thereof, be 
sentenced to pay a fine of not more than Five Hundred Dollars ($500.00), or undergo 
imprisonment for not more than thirty (30) days. 
Section 504. – Remedies Not Mutually Exclusive 
The remedies provided in this Article are not mutually exclusive.  The utilization by the 
Treasurer of one remedy does not preclude utilization of the other. 
Moreover, use of either or both of the remedies provided in these Sections does not 
preclude the use by the City of Pittsburgh of any other legal or administrative procedure 
which can bring about compliance by the Taxpayer with the provisions of Chapter 241 
of the Pittsburgh Code and these regulations. 
Once it has been determined that that a Taxpayer owes a tax, the Treasurer will take 
all actions legally permitted to enforce its claim. Such action may include obtaining 
additional information, auditing Taxpayer records, entering into a settlement of the 
disputed amount of the tax, or obtaining liens on the Taxpayer’s property, wage 
attachments, levies, and seizures and sales of the Taxpayer’s property in appropriate 
circumstances. The Treasurer may enter into a written agreement with the Taxpayer for 
payment of the tax in installments if the Treasurer believes that such an agreement will 
facilitate collection. The Treasurer may also impose interest and applicable penalties 
on the tax due, and may seek criminal charges in appropriate circumstances.
