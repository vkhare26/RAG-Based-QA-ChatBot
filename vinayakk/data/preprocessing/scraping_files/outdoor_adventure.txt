Parks

Western Pennsylvania is home to some of the most diverse landscape in the United States.

Pittsburgh is a green city – not just because of our environmentally friendly buildings and city programs, but because of our parks! Hike, bike, hunt, fish, canoe or ride through our beautiful backyard.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

City Parks

The

City of Pittsburgh is home to 176 parks

, ranging from regional parks to small neighborhood parklets.

Schenley Park

contains 456 acres of trails, woods, and attractions. A daily destination for university students, professionals, and outdoor enthusiasts, the park also hosts

major annual events

such as the

Vintage Grand Prix

and the Pittsburgh Race for the Cure. Visitors of Schenley Park can enjoy lunch and a concert at the Schenley Park Café and Visitor Center, relax on Flagstaff Hill, play a round at the Bob O’Connor Golf Course, head to the Schenley Oval Sportsplex for ice skating or

summer

sports, or take a dip in the swimming pool. The trails offer a refreshing and convenient escape from the city. The Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy restored the Schenley Park Café and Visitor Center in 2001 and operates the space today with event and culinary partners, Eat'n Park Hospitality Group. In 2005, the Parks Conservancy worked with the City of Pittsburgh to rehabilitate the Phipps Run stream channel that stretches from behind the Visitor Center down to Panther Hollow Lake. Restoration of the Panther Hollow Watershed is continuous, with the goal of restoring Panther Hollow Lake to a water quality that will once again allow for recreational use.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Frick Park

is known as Pittsburgh’s woodland park for its extensive trails throughout steep valleys and wooded slopes—it’s an ideal escape from the noise of the city. Enthusiasts love to visit Clayton Hill, where well over 100 species of birds have been recorded. Children flock to the famous Blue Slide Playground and learn about nature at the Frick Environmental Center. The park also features red clay tennis courts, baseball fields, and the only public lawn bowling green in Pennsylvania. The Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy has completed extensive ecological restoration work in Frick Park since the Conservancy’s first capital project in 2000, the restoration of Reynolds Street gatehouse entrance. The Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy, in partnership with the City of Pittsburgh, opened the new Frick Environmental Center to the public in September 2016, and in 2018 it was certified as a Living Building, achieving Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Platinum status.

Emerald View Park

visitors can enjoy 257 acres of winding trails, wooded hillsides, and surprise vistas. Historic spaces within the park feature picnic areas, playgrounds, ballfields, overlooks, and Depression-era sandstone steps and walls. Thanks to the tireless efforts of groups like the Mount Washington Community Development Corporation, the City of Pittsburgh, and partners in the community, a master plan was created for Emerald View Park, as well as a plan for 19 miles of new trails. Through removal of dumpsites, habitat restoration, trail development and capital improvements, this land has been reclaimed as a park. Efforts outlined in the Master Implementation Plan (2005) and Master Trail Plan (2010) continue, along with beautification along the nearby Grand View Scenic Byway. Future planning efforts between the Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy, Mount Washington Community Development Corporation, and the City of Pittsburgh ensures that Emerald View Park will continue to thrive and grow.

Highland Park

features a popular bike track, swimming pool, sand volleyball courts, and the

Pittsburgh Zoo & Aquarium

. A water filtration plant cleans the water from the main reservoir, and waste water is naturally de-chlorinated in part by a brook which trickles into Lake Carnegie.

Beginning with the creation of the Babbling Brook in 2003, the Pittsburgh Parks Conservancy has completed several major park improvement projects in Highland Park. The Entry Garden was restored in 2005. In 2006, the Conservancy worked with the City of Pittsburgh to create a series of seasonal pools along Washington Boulevard. These pools provide a unique urban wetland habitat while dramatically reducing the impact of stormwater runoff. Future plans for the park include work on Heth’s Run, which includes creating a new trail, adding athletic fields, and connecting the park to the Allegheny River.

Riverview Park

is a jewel of Pittsburgh’s North Side. Nestled between Perrysville Avenue, Woods Run and Marshall Avenue, the 259-acre park is known for its wooded trails and dramatically steep hillsides. The park’s extensive network of trails invites hikers, joggers, and the occasional horseback rider into the woods. The park is also home to the landmark Allegheny Observatory, a swimming pool and activities building, and the popular two-mile Riverview Loop. Residents enjoy the park's pool, playground, ball field, shelters and summertime concerts and movies. The Chapel Shelter, a historic picnic shelter that was once a Presbyterian church, was restored by the Parks Conservancy in 2008. Restoration of the building and the surrounding landscape included creation of a new trail, plantings of numerous native trees and shrubs, and clearing invasive species. Future plans for the park include restoring the historic Watson’s Cabin and continuing restoration of the Snyder’s Point natural area.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Waterfront Parks

Thirteen miles of Downtown Pittsburgh's riverfront park system interconnect to form

Three Rivers Park

, featuring more than 800 acres of open space for the general public to enjoy. Current boundaries are marked by the West End Bridge over the Ohio River, the 31st Street Bridge over the Allegheny River and the Hot Metal Bridge over the Monongahela River.

North Shore Riverfront Park

shows off one of the city's greatest examples of revitalization, attracting joggers, cyclists and boaters to the area surrounding the beauty of Heinz Field and PNC Park. On the other side of the Allegheny is the

David L. Lawrence Convention Center Riverfront Plaza

, which provides a passageway from

Point State Park

to the

Strip District

and gives people a place to gather in front of the largest "green" building in the world. A five-acre parking lot dating back to the days of Pittsburgh's heavy industrial age was replaced with flood-resistant plants, water-access steps and improved infrastructure to create the

Mon Wharf Landing

. Across the Monongahela is the

South Shore Riverfront Park

, located at the popular SouthSide Works complex. The park features a piazza, boat dock and concert stage and serves as an important connection for the Great Allegheny Passage and Three Rivers Heritage Trail.
