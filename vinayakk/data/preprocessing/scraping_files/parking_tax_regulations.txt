parking rate for comparable public lots in the area.  
 
For the purposes of these Parking Tax Regulations, a valet service providing 
attendants who drive the patron’s vehicle from the entrance of an establishment and 
park the vehicle in a licensed, public facility, whether the facility is open to the public on a 
single fee transaction or a monthly fee basis or lease, and pass along the charge for

ARTICLE 3: IMPOSITION OF TAX 
§ 301.  RATE OF TAX. 
 
(a) 
Rate of tax. A tax for general revenue purposes is hereby imposed upon each 
parking transaction by a patron of a non-residential parking place at the rate of 
thirty-seven and one-half (37.5) percent for all transactions occurring on or after 
January 1, 2009. The rate of tax may be changed for any tax year by the 
legislative actions of the Mayor and City Council.  However, the tax rate may not 
exceed the rate permitted by the Municipal Pension Plan Funding Standard and 
Recovery Act, 53 P.S. § 895.902. 
 
(b) 
Calculation of tax. The following method must be used to compute the tax, 
whether the tax total is taken from individual cash register tapes or where 
individual tax collections are not kept for each ticket:  
 
Simplified Calculation.  For ease of administration and tax collection, the tax 
return presumes that gross collections include both total consideration from the 
patron and collected parking tax from the patron. Under this simplified 
calculation the applicable tax rates is 27.273% times gross collections. 
 
 
The rate of tax is defined above and will be applied as follows: 
 
Parking Fee 
X 
Tax Rate 
= 
Parking Tax Due 
 
For example, where the tax rate is 37.5%: 
 
$1,000.00 
X 
37.5% 
= 
$375.00 
$1,550.00 
X 
37.5% 
= 
$581.25 
 
(c) 
Calculation of total payment. The following method shall be used to compute 
the total payment collected by the operator and paid by the patron, whether the tax 
total is taken from individual cash register tapes or where individual collections are 
not kept for each ticket. The rate of tax is defined above and will be applied as 
follows: 
 
Parking Fee 
+ 
Parking Tax 
= 
Total Payment 
 
For example, where the tax rate is 37.5%: 
$1,000.00 
+ 
$375.00 
= 
$1,375.00 
$1,550.00 
+ 
$581.25 
= 
$2,131.25 
 
(d) 
Calculation of total payment where there is a surcharge. The following method 
shall be used to compute the total payment collected by the operator and paid by 
the patron when a surcharge is imposed, whether the tax total is taken from 
individual cash register tapes or where individual collections are not kept for each 
ticket. The parking tax will be applied to the sum of the base parking fee and the 
surcharge. The rate of tax is defined above and will be applied as follows: 
 

-11- 
 
(Base Fee + Surcharge)  + Tax Rate(Base Fee + Surcharge) = Total Payment 
 
For example, where the tax rate is 37.5% and the surcharge is $10: 
($1,000.00 + $10.00) 
+ 
$378.75 
= 
$1,388.75 
($1,550.00 + $10.00) 
+ 
$585.00 
= 
$2,145.00 
 
§ 302.  COLLECTION OF TAX. 
 
(a) 
Collection by operator or provider.  A tax for general revenue purposes is imposed 
upon each patron entering into a parking transaction, at the specified rate of the

§ 501. POWERS OF TREASURER. 
 
(a) 
It shall be the duty of the Treasurer to collect and receive the taxes, fines, and 
penalties imposed by the Code. It shall also be the duty of the Treasurer to keep a 
record showing the date of such receipt and provide the taxpayer with proof of

Inspections. 
 
(b) 
The Treasurer is charged with the administration and enforcement of the 
provisions of the City Code and these Regulations. The Treasurer is empowered 
to prescribe, adopt, promulgate and enforce rules and regulations relating to any 
matter pertaining to the administration and enforcement of the City Code. This 
power includes, but is not limited to: 
 
(1) 
The power to observe parking spaces in order to verify that the 
information provided by the operator to the Treasurer is an accurate and 
correct representation of the operator’s business operations, including but 
not limited to, the volume of cars in the parking space, the consideration 
being collected, and the consistency of the operator’s reporting procedures; 
 
(2) 
The power to reexamine and correct declarations and returns, payments 
alleged or found to be incorrect, and overpayments claimed or found to 
have occurred; 
 
(3) 
The power to examine the books, papers, records, or other relevant 
documentation of any supposed operator, in accordance with these 
Regulations and as described in Section 502; 
 
(4) 
The power, when records are not available to the City to support the returns 
filed or which should have been filed, to compel the operator to make them 
available to the Treasurer; 
 
(5) 
The power to prescribe forms necessary for the administration of the Code 
and these Regulations; and 
 
(6) 
The power to issue citations for violations of these Regulation and institute

§ 502.  RECORDS REQUIRED.

records shall be preserved for a period of not less than five (5) years from the filing date

-20- 
 
or due date, whichever is later, in order to enable the Treasurer to verify the correctness 
of the declarations or returns. 
 
§ 503. EXAMINATION OF BOOKS AND RECORDS. 
 
(a) 
Agents designated by the Treasurer are hereby authorized to examine the books, 
papers, and records of any operator or supposed operator, in order to verify the

ascertain the tax due. Every operator or supposed operator, is hereby directed and 
required to give to the Treasurer, or to any agent designated by him/her, the 
means, facilities, and opportunity for such examinations and investigations, as are 
hereby authorized. 
 
(b) 
If records are not available in the City of Pittsburgh to support the returns which 
were filed or which should have been filed, the operator will be required to make 
them available to the Treasurer either by producing them in a City of Pittsburgh 
location or by paying for the expenses incurred by the Treasurer in traveling to the 
place where the records are regularly kept. 
 
(c) 
The Treasurer may issue and serve subpoenas to carry out these provisions. 
 
(d) 
Any information gained by the Treasurer, by designated agents, or by any other 
official or agent of the City of Pittsburgh, as a result of any declarations, returns, 
investigations, hearings or verifications required or authorized by the Code, shall 
be confidential except for official purposes and shall not be released except in 
accordance with a proper judicial order, or as otherwise provided by law. 
 
§ 504.  RECORD RETENTION. 
 
Operators and Providers who collect the Parking Tax are required to keep such records

whichever is later in order to enable the Treasurer to verify the correctness of the 
declarations or returns filed. 
 
§ 505.  AUDITS. 
 
If, as a result of an examination conducted by the Treasurer, a return is found to be 
incorrect, the Treasurer is authorized to assess and collect any underpayments of the 
Parking Tax. If no return has been filed and a tax is found to be due, the tax actually due 
may be assessed and collected with or without the formality of obtaining a return from the 
operator or provider. Deficiency assessments (i.e., where operator or provider has filed a 
return but is found to owe additional tax) must include records for up to five (5) years prior 
to the date when the deficiency is assessed. Where no return was filed, there will be no 
limit to the period of assessment.  Any assessment will be issued in accordance with 53 
Pa.C.S. § 8427 
 
(a) 
If records are not available in the City to support the returns which were filed or 
which should have been filed, the taxpayer will be required to make them

-21- 
 
the records are regularly kept.

A taxpayer or employer has 30 days from the mailing date to respond to written 
requests for information from the City or its agents, unless an extension of time is 
granted in accordance with 53 Pa.C.S. § 8424.

Any information gained by the Treasurer, by designated agents, or by any other 
official or agent of the City, as a result of any declarations, returns, 
investigations, hearings or verifications required or authorized by the Code, shall 
be confidential except for official purposes, and shall not be released except in 
accordance with a proper judicial order, or as otherwise provided by law.  53 
Pa.C.S. § 8437.

ARTICLE 6: VIOLATIONS 
 
§ 601.  REMEDIES NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE. 
 
The remedies provided in this Article are not mutually exclusive. The utilization by the 
Treasurer of one or more remedies does not preclude utilization another. Moreover, use 
of any or all of the remedies provided in these Sections does not preclude the use by the 
City of any other legal or administrative procedure which can bring about compliance by 
the operator with the provisions of the Code and these Regulations. 
 
Once it has been determined that that a taxpayer owes a tax, the Treasurer will take all 
actions legally permitted to enforce its claim. Such action may include obtaining additional 
information, auditing taxpayer records, entering into a settlement of the disputed amount of 
the tax, or obtaining liens on the taxpayer’s property, wage attachments, levies, and 
seizures and sales of the taxpayer’s property in appropriate circumstances. The Treasurer 
may enter into a written agreement with the taxpayer for payment of the tax in installments 
if the Treasurer believes that such an agreement will facilitate collection. The Treasurer 
may also impose interest and applicable penalties on the tax due, and may seek criminal 
charges in appropriate circumstances.  See, Local Tax Enabling Act, 53 P.S. § 6924.702. 
 
 
§ 602. PENALTY AND INTEREST. 
 
(a) 
If for any reason the Parking Tax is not paid in whole or in part when due, a penalty 
at the rate of five percent (5%) per month of the amount of the Parking Tax will be 
added and collected as penalty for every month or fraction thereof during the time 
the Parking Tax goes unpaid, such penalty not to exceed fifty percent (50%). 
Once due and owing, penalty becomes part of the Parking Tax. 
 
(b) 
In addition to the penalty, interest of one percent (1%) for every month or fraction 
thereof will be added to the delinquent tax balance which will continue to accrue 
until the full payment of the tax principal is made.  In no event shall the interest rate 
assessed exceed the maximum rate allowed by the Municipal Claims and Tax Liens 
Act, 53 P.S. 7143, or applicable law. 
 
(c) 
On any additional Parking Fee determined to be due as a result of a deficiency 
notice, penalty and interest will be assessed from the day the Parking Tax should 
have been paid to the date of payment. Penalty and interests are calculated in 
Section 602(a) and 602(b), respectively. 
 
(d) 
Where suit is brought for the recovery of the Parking Tax, the person liable therefor 
shall, in addition, be liable for the costs of collection, penalties, and interest herein 
imposed. 
 
(e) 
A person’s belief that no Parking Tax is due and owing, or the failure of any person 
to receive or obtain the forms required for making the returns required by the Code 
is not a valid defense to the imposition of penalties for violation herein.  Good faith 
shall not be a defense to the imposition of penalty. 
 
 

-23- 
 
§ 603. VIOLATIONS AND FINES. 
 
(a)

In the appropriate circumstances, the Treasurer will enter an installment payment plan and 
defer further collection action, if the taxpayer enters into a written agreement with the

days after the date of notice of the assessment, request a Treasurer’s Hearing 
on a form obtained from the Treasurer for that purpose. 53 Pa.C.S. § 8431. The 
Treasurer may on his/her own initiative cite a taxpayer for a hearing.  
  
(a) 
Any taxpayer who fails to request a Treasurer’s Hearing within a timely 
manner, waives the right to contest any element of the assessment, and 
that party’s failure to challenge the Treasurer’s adjudication will be 
construed as an admission by that party as to the propriety of the 
assessment. 
 
(b) 
The written petition for reassessment shall contain at minimum: 
 
(1) 
The taxpayer’s name, address, and daytime telephone number.

is timely filed, the aggrieved party waives his/her right to contest any element of 
the Treasurer’s adjudication, and that party’s failure to challenge the same will 

-27- 
 
be construed as an admission by that party as to the propriety of the 
Treasurer’s decision. No hearing or appeal will operate to suspend the accrual of 
penalty and interest from the date the tax was due to the date it is actually paid. 
§ 703.  REFUNDS. 
(a) 
Requests for refunds. An operator that has overpaid Parking Taxes to the 
City of Pittsburgh due to an error reporting monthly collections may file a 
written request with the Department of Finance for a refund or a credit of

the month in which the error occurred, the total amount of tax properly due 
for the report period in which the overpayment was made, and the 
amount of tax collected and paid to the City of Pittsburgh for the 
applicable period, including the total amount of and reason for the 
overpayment. An amended Parking Tax return may be required for the 
adjusted report period.  All refunds shall be processed consistently with the 
Local Tax Enabling Act and the Local Taxpayer Bill of Rights, 53 Pa.C.S §

taxpayer of an underpayment, a written request for a refund shall be 
filed with the Department of Finance within one (1) year of the date of 
the payment. 
 
(4) 
A tax return filed by the taxpayer with the Department of Finance 
showing an overpayment of tax shall be deemed to be a written 
request for a cash refund unless otherwise indicated on the tax return. 
 
(b) 
Proof of receipt. If any claim of overpayment is made to the City of 
Pittsburgh after reported Parking Tax was collected from but subsequently 
refunded to any patron; for example, the refunding of any portion of a prepaid 
lease, the operator must be able to provide proof that the patron received the 
refund and that therefund amount was properly due and calculated.  No 
refund or credit shall be claimed by an operator if overpaid amounts are not 
or cannot be refunded to the patrons from whom they were originally 
collected.

ARTICLE 8:  SAVINGS AND SEVERABILITY AND DISCLOSURES 
 
§ 801. SAVINGS CLAUSE AND SEVERABILITY.

regulations, or the application of any provision to any circumstances, to be illegal or 
unconstitutional, the other provisions in these regulations, or the application of such
